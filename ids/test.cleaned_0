20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-000025-000121 Hello
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-000080-000186 Hello.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-000216-000408 Hello. Who is this?

20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-000574-000695 Guillermo
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-000695-000781 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-000756-000973 This is Jos√©
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-000897-001094 How is it going, where are you from?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-001109-001396 But I live here in Philadelphia.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-001376-001492 In Philadelphia.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-001457-001729 Yes and you?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-001714-001956 I am Peruvian. I am studying at the University of Pennsylvania.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-002289-002455 What do you study?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-002410-002732 I study history
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-002672-002798 Oh I am also a student here, I'm a senior
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-003161-003317 What university?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-003302-003524 From, University of Pennsylvania too.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-003463-003594 Oh, yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-003584-003731 Yes, I'm almost finished here.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-003983-004089 Oh that's good.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-004104-004255 But
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-004114-004336 And you are studying, is that you?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-004310-004613 I'm in Wharton
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-004608-004714 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-004623-004921 If it's business, but then you are a student for a PhD or the Master's?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-005631-005828 Is that undergraduate?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-005813-006030 I'm an undergraduate
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-005899-006000 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-006045-006322 But these hours here
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-006297-006524 Sorry?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-006327-006504 But then did you live in Peru?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-006539-006736 I am sorry as you say?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-006741-006862 Did you live in Peru?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-006811-007235 I was living in Peru until three (3) months ago.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-007321-007492 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-007492-007734 Clearly
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-007699-007926 Then you're a freshman
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-007890-008329 No, what happened what I studied at the University of Peru for two years and then I transferred. I'm an international transfer
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-008359-008500 You are not an exchange student, you are a transfer.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-008939-009035 I will graduate with a degree from this university
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-009055-009221 That's good
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-009413-009882 As opposed to an exchange student who doesn't.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-009731-010073 What do you think so far?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-010013-010351 It's a bit hard, to tell you the truth
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-010220-010452 Yes, I believe it is English.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-010447-010820 Oh yeah
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-010452-010724 All the work.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-010820-011042 I have studied English for most of my life, but it's always more difficult to express myself in English than in Spanish.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-011768-011914 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-011808-011974 That's very clear for me.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-012161-012247 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-012221-012297 Because of the amount of work they send me
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-012751-012907 More than in Peru?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-012917-013129 Yes, I think so. They send you more.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-013038-013220 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-013149-013371 Even in the last cycle at the university in Peru i took six classes in one semester.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-014031-014122 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-014248-014450 I'm taking 5 classes currently, working more than ever.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-014823-015015 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-014929-015216 I'm talking five classes, but I also work.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-015206-015453 Ok
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-015247-015620 That's the equivalent to taking six classes maybe.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-015620-015736 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-015645-015892 Maybe it's a little less, I don't think it's so demanding as taking six classes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-016164-016487 Yes, but it's still pretty intensive
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-016371-016724 I think so. Maybe in the future I'll decide to
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-016492-016673 Yes, it's hard
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-016724-016926 How many courses do you take per cycle?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-017168-017273 I think i ony took four but now i am taking five
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-018332-018564 Yeah, and you
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-018388-018721 But, in general, people in College only take four
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-018776-018917 I see.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-018867-019210 In Wharton people generally take five
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-019134-019376 I see. And do you work?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-019381-019568 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-019391-019764 Are you a full time student?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-019648-019769 I have a library job, Work Study. But it's not really a job because when I'm there
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-020561-020929 I study. It's not like that.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-020672-021000 I also work in the library but i am a shelver
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-021594-021756 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-021610-021912 So, it really doesn't give me the chance to study.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-021842-022094 What you are doing I did that sometimes in part of the library.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-022326-022421 On the fifth floor of Van Pelt
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-022593-022840 Okay
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-022719-022936 Where are you employed.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-022880-023021 In Lippinott
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-023006-023112 Where's that?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-023117-023405 It's the library at Wharton.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-023319-023576 Yea
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-023425-023642 Yes, it's on the second floor. It's a good job because I work alone. I don't work too many hours, just five hours a week. Sometimes I work ten hours.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-024584-024952 I do my homework, there are times there's only a little bit more than a month of work left
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-025391-025633 There's more people who need help
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-025527-025673 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-025633-025699 Is doing their research but in general, no I dont have a lot of work.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-026344-026450 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-026369-026440 Yes but what I've seen is that sometimes in Latin America, but you saw that in Europe,
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-027292-027478 In universities there's not a lot of work until the end
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-028028-028265 In England, for example?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-028220-028462 Europe in general.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-028270-028608 The amount of the number of hours that you have in class each week
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-028991-029077 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-028996-029238 They are less than three
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-029208-029354 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-029273-029344 You have a lot of free time. Doesn't have much class.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-029626-029773 Yes.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-029647-029914 And aside from that, they don't give you a lot of work. I'm not sure.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-030252-030584 Yes well no they don't give them much work but in general they want that we, well it is supposed true that one is
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-031179-031568 Hat one reads all, that they are doing exercises, and that they continue doing all that
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-031321-031411 Of course
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-031573-031724 I understand. In the end they give exam for a grade. Here in the United States, it's
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-032400-032803 One has to investigate history, then write an essay and take an exam.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-033095-033216 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-033453-033504 That is the best in the sense that there are less risks but
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-034038-034547 That is definitely an advantage.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-034134-034280 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-034547-034855 Imagine that you go to decide your exam grade. The night before you couldn't sleep
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-035783-036025 Whichever may have happened, and all of a sudden
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-035969-036151 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-036025-036176 You may have prepared a lot but for X reason it didn't go well in the exam.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-036640-036726 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-036806-036917 I mean let's say your grade
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-037129-037250 Yeah,
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-037149-037406 I mean, your grade goes down, I don't know.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-037321-037426 No, there's all the work they give you every week that is one thing after another
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-037936-038188 Another job
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-037996-038309 Yes.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-038208-038329 Every system has it's advantages. But in Peru, how is it in general?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-038697-038964 Let's see, i would say they also make us work, we don't, we have an equivalent to midterms
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-039468-039605 Yes.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-039524-039776 But they're mostly reading controls.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-039771-039897 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-039826-040285 I'd like it spread throughout the semester
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-040305-040396 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-040411-040492 Eassy at the end of the course
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-041263-041359 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-041299-041526 You also have a final exam. You don't have to produce as much as you do here.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-041581-041707 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-041914-042085 You don't have to write much.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-041914-042025 Right.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-042121-042342 Here they're like constantly making you writing papers, and reviews, right?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-042635-042776 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-042796-043013 There not so much there instead what you had to write, for example, you wrote it in the exam, or to give in the investigation.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-043457-043557 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-043754-044152 In the final semester. But aside all of that, no, you didn't have to produce much.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-044132-044289 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-044173-044334 That could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have to ask much.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-045247-045478 One can live more relaxed.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-045473-045645 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-045478-045751 The disadvantage is that you are not in a constant practice of labor of
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-046638-046825 Investigation,I mean sometimes one for not writing much
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-047697-047818 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-047924-048257 It's easier
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-047959-048110 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-048257-048559 It's easier, but I don't know if they form it so well like they form it here.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-048877-049144 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-049033-049336 It has a cost in that they form you better. For example, I am very busy this last weekend.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-049956-050137 You live a little mor, at least, I live a little more anxious, a little more.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-050556-050682 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-050591-050783 Stressed
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-050742-050904 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-050909-051201 But I don't know how Wharton might be I don't know.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-051126-051277 Yes, it is different, in Wharton it depends because classes I take in general don't have
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-052300-052547 Like essays or research, only in general, two, three exams, and that's it. But there are classes for example that have more like that well, you have the two exams, but you also have projects.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-053515-053626 OK.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-053556-053778 These case studies

20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-053929-054221 In groups, in general, those days almost everything is in groups. And if they give you homework to be reviewing, because otherwise
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-054912-055189 I like that every week you have homework. A small one to turn in, because that way
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-055673-056011 One has- they make you study every week truly.

20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-056783-056909 Each class always has an exam. I don't, I have never had a class where there were only projects, true, but in general two exams, and maybe one project.

20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-057650-057882 Now in the Marketing class we have a project, I don't know how they did it
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-058552-058921 They created a whole piece of software that is like a simulation and then one, for example, each request well there are like five orders, or six orders, then
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-059475-059596 You have a group.

20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-059974-060529 This company has several products, then, you have to decide based on, each product where are we going, what kind of
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-060978-061331 How are we going to sell this product, we are going to
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-061230-061482 That is interesting.

20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-061915-062258 It resembles at least in some
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-061941-062057 You have to write some essays like that, to make an analysis
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-063055-063413 Of the mistakes you made, of what you did well
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-063347-063524 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-063413-063741 Everything depends on the course but there are many things like that too.

20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-063892-064084 I hardly write anything in general. It looked pretty weird that I had to write
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-064633-064835 Yeah
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-064684-064830 But, have you been living long here in the United States?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-065233-065405 Why?
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-065334-065551 Too much cold here
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-065480-065707 Well yes. I think it was on Tuesday at night that was raining.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-066015-066090 Yes
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-066090-066544 I got frozen, yes. I have to go with my coat, I mean I bought a coat that shelters a lot

20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-067073-067346 And I have for, well, I always go out with it. But still, sometimes even using the coat, I get cold too. But well inside my room it is more,

20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-068092-068284 Manageable the matter of the inside the dorm yea, the temperature it's good enough

20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-069060-069257 Warm, right.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-069166-069539 But in Peru, I've heard there are parts where it really gets cold.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-069448-069645 Yes if you go to the mountains
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-069660-069831 None
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-069761-070194 Also at nighttime more than anything. If you go to the mountains in wintertime, the nights are really cold.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-A-070593-070794 Yeah I see.
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-070673-070860 I must have gone to the mountains in peru on vacation with my family at night
20051028_180633_356_fsp-B-071536-071657 It could get even colder than the cold I've experienced here.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-000015-000096 Hello?
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-000085-000247 Hello, my name is Glori.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-000212-000485 Hello, Gloria. I am Paulina. Where are you calling from?
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-000404-000459 From New York
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-000616-000808 I am in Georgia.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-000722-000828 From Long Island

20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-000889-000990 From Long Island.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-001106-001157 None
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-001167-001314 I am in Athens, Georgia
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-001334-001587 Oh, from Georgia, on my God
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-001450-001531 How is it?
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-001703-001915 I didn't understand what she said.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-001925-002006 What?
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-001961-002133 Something about religion. She said she talks
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-002168-002320 You didn't understand what she said.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-002315-002360 No
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-002532-003320 She was talking about the religion, what is the opinion about religion, if it unifies people, or separate them, if all the people should belong to the same religion,
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-002780-002860 Ah, okay. I am Catholic. So I believe it joins some and seperates others. For example, I have a nephew that is gay.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-005074-005428 Catholics don't accept gay people.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-005423-005509 None
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-005550-005777 They say that God didn't make them that way. So, I remember when my nephew was born, we knew that he was going to be one
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-006581-006975 People never believe that they are born that way but he was. And if you have someone in your family you know. So, he
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-007521-008037 Has a lot of problems with the Catholic religion, because they don't accept him and he knows he's not accepted. So, he finally found a church, in the thirty-two, in New York, that accepts homosexuals.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-008825-008906 I see. I think if people would stick to their religion, there wouldn't be that many problems.  They wouldn't go to extremes, every religion

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-010377-011085 If people would follow what Jesus Christ said and his teachings, if they would act like he did

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-011110-011277 There wouldn't be a problem.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-011337-011524 But when they start fighting, that's not what he taught us!

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-011666-011767 Jesus Christ.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-011777-011893 Exactly.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-011797-012015 WHEN TROUBLE ARISES

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-012202-012616 Or the Jews, the principles of that religions teach us to,

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-012616-012702 People become fanatic and don't accept other people.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-013379-013642 I believe that when there is division, problems.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-013637-013774 Yes. What was I going to say? At lunch time to the girls where I work, three
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-014613-015083 I take this little book by Joyce Myers and everyday scriptures. I read them and they tell me that is shit but
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-015851-016862 Listen to what she is saying, treat your neighbor well.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-016862-017428 I don't like her, but everybody is created in the image of God. Ay, we start to fight. Then, I say, look, I want peace because
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-018303-018540 We talk about today's subject. But one has been made. They still look for me to read every day.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-019450-020087 Because, there is one that is like a firecracker, and I was telling her that I don't want to hang out with her because she drains
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-020087-020653 All my energy. And, she is always criticizing everyone, and I don't want, I don't want to be in this environment. She says, yes I read to her everyday, the other days she is saying,
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-021139-021614 Write down five things you are thankful to God for. Who do you think you are? You are always reading something about religion.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-022539-022958 I know I am a good person.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-023691-024015 If I let people influence me, I would have already jumped out of a window
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-024045-024121 Yes
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-024106-024449 And, then he needed some kind of tension of emergencies here things that
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-025167-025415 And it is true, the same as the
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-025263-025349 Yes
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-025445-025754 In one on one relationships, or like what happens in Israel, amongst the

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-026244-026426 Between the Palestinians and the,

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-026436-026562 And the Jews.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-026567-026749 It's sad, and they go fighting

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-026911-027285 Because for the two there are sacred places but they dont respect.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-027432-027538 Other people.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-027563-028053 It's that, precisely the Catholic religion, the whole world is going, like my friend went to another church. She tells me,
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-028468-028898 You have to find that church that fits you.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-029438-030080 I'm not going to tell you that you should go to the Catholic church, if it's not giving you anything because I go to Catholic church.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-030116-030919 She asked me to go to other church with herbut I refused
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-030950-031228 I am not going with her
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-032016-032734 I have been to that church many times. It takes all day Sunday and I don't have the whole day on Sunday to be there.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-032754-032921 Three hours, four hours.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-033063-033285 What religion goes, is your friend?
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-033184-033538 I believe it's something like Christian Science.

20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-033578-033877 They are like born again Christians
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-033882-034003 Yeah.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-033988-034099 Yes, you know she was Catholic. But, the husband goes to the Catholic Church. In my house, the only one going to church is me. I don't think she likes to go, she always fights with me when she goes.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-035443-035757 I twelve.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-036257-036839 Of Katrina, and he says God made that, which

20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-036839-037663 None
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-037673-037814 God does not allow them.  Even though the Bible said that a lot of those things would occur.  I was telling him to ready the Bible.  It will show you what there is.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-038643-038810 Yes.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-038709-038780 None
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-038901-039366 That's the way it is, I find that, regarding religion, many people go solely by tradition, and
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-039386-039502 Yes.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-039401-039588 When one goes and finds the truth
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-039770-039851 None
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-039831-040144 And there, one finds a religion that.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-040301-040534 Yes
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-040448-040640 Many people who go, solely by religion, do not know what their own religion is about
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-041034-041721 Exactly. They sit there, and once the father is finished, the leave, they run.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-041641-041964 Yes, or they don't study what's written for themselves, or anything.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-041939-042030 Yes.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-042121-042192 Yes. Help when we start studying, who would believe, it's your own religion.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-042272-042338 Yes. Ultimately I am going to a charismatic group. I am understanding more, even though they speak Spanish and I dont understand, I can speak Spanish but not read or write it.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-043855-044178 They gave me a Hispanic bible, and I am reading it. Then, I go and explain to them that I read this, and this, and this.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-044855-045250 That is what they read in English to see if I can understand. But the bible is much too difficult.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-045523-045775 The bible is difficult because of the vocabulary that it uses.  Doesn't matter what language.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-046114-046498 I find it very difficult. They give me some passages, and I read them, and then they tell me this is this, and this is this, and this is this
20051029_211606_365_fsp-A-047358-047823 I begin to use it in our lives. Then, I understand.
20051029_211606_365_fsp-B-047974-048202 Where are you from?

20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-030743-030909 What kind of music do you play?

20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-033240-033315 Yes.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-033305-033396 There are other Chilean singers but I don't like them as much as the
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-033912-034064 The law
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-034023-034119 The law.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-034114-034336 I didn't know that the law was Chilean.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-034377-034493 Yes, they are Chilean. This Miriam Hernandez is Chilean also. She sings romantic music but I don't personally like her much

20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-035423-035509 To see, if I remember something from Venezuela
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-035838-036050 Of Ricardo Montaner?
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-036080-036480 The sound sounds each time
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-036414-036586 Yes, it is Ricardo Montaner yes. And this Frank Sinatra.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-036869-037187 I also hear that Franco and Son are good.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-037000-037076 It's famous for Venezuela
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-038219-038279 Who?
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-038249-038451 Idan called
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-038507-038598 No
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-038689-038749 He is good, but is no longer famous outside of Venezuala. He is called Idan and his music is very good.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-039422-039477 How long have you been in America?
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-040003-040190 I have five years now.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-040195-040473 Five years. Do you speak good English?
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-040478-040609 Yeah. I find it easy.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-040786-041125 Did you get your citizenship or not?
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-041059-041241 But the home is because I have one more that four years of marriage
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-041757-041853 None
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-041934-042050 Then
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-041954-042414 After three years of marriage you can apply for Citizenship
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-042485-042687 Yes, but what happens is that I have a double-citizenship, I have my citizenship in Venezuela and I have my Italian citizenship.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-043385-043556 Because my father is Italian.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-043410-043470 Oh, do you speak Italian?
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-043804-043986 Yes

20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-044021-044335 I think that if I accept the American citizenship, I'll have to
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-044562-044673 Quit now
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-044714-044997 Citizenship, and that's not good for me
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-045164-045497 The other two citizenships, have you researched something about it? because currently in Chile we have double citizenship, it could be American citizenship
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-046569-046963 Yes, but the problem is I have two, they won't let you have three
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-046958-047191 You are right
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-047181-047262 Yes
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-047262-047403 It's a little complicated.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-047413-047499 Yes
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-047499-047651 Are you happy with the residence? Your parents are

20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-049122-049223 Okay.  Are your uncles in Italy?

20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-057533-057796 But you can take them out for a walk. I used to live in an apartment, I moved here abut five months ago and I've been here for three months with the dog, the cat, the plant
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-058989-059095 And the aquarium. I used to take my dog out for a walk outside.

20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-061683-061809 This is the question. But we are thinking of moving to this

20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-063083-063169 Few that are going to change soon.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-063432-063831 We are waiting to buy a house close by here.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-063962-064099 To move
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-064089-064342 If so we can move. We can be able to find a puppy or anything else.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-064842-065064 Not feel like we moved out one month ago. This is my home.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-065883-066020 We had to close the yard and place cartons all around to have the hill just outside.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-066823-066935 Exactly.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-066960-067218 It can enter and leave the garage but it has the gate opened and has a space where it can walk, run and play.
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-067870-068037 Yes, I want it. If it can enter and leave freely, it can play in the yard and that
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-068512-068598 And has
20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-068577-068916 Runs all around exercising

20051030_193924_371_fsp-B-069391-069462 Yes if your are thinking of a reason why
20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-070281-070463 It's very little.

20051030_193924_371_fsp-A-070842-070923 Which are ?

20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-025450-025586 That is from Argentina
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-025591-025674 Yes
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-025747-025925 Yes, I like it a lot
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-026039-026097 Okay
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-026102-026217 He does not believe that God is helping him, so everyday I tell him, you see, God gave you that, since today we were talking about
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-027046-027120 That
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-027052-027187 And the one who died, him too was a very good singer but more or less, where I live, there are many people who play
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-027683-027756 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-028064-028293 Many of our friends that play and sing and have bands
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-028455-028502 Yes
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-028455-028674 All of the groups they have are very good
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-028831-028893 I go to one or two concerts each year
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-030146-030234 But in general the type of concert I'm going to is more like rock in english, and the people that go are more
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-031043-031325 They are too scandalous. For that, I didn't pay too much attention to going to concerts.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-032107-032180 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-032113-032248 I went to a Willie Nelson concert this year.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-032686-032744 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-032728-032874 And Bob Dylan
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-033005-033067 Yes
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-033078-033213 It had people of every age. There were people that were sixty or seventy years old and kids that were barely ten or eight years old in the concert.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-034027-034074 Yes
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-034121-034288 Yes. It was held in a small baseball stadium and there weren't so many people there because of that.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-035389-035613 Was very good concert.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-035697-036015 You buy music or have many CD's?
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-036172-036271 We buy more music than anything. We also bought a lot from groups that are not very popular, of people we know.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-037304-037366 Yeah.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-037382-037518 Yes, because we are members of one of the folk music societies of Philadelphia. At least there are many musicians
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-038660-038864 Who are members and there are concerts in the homes, they do this every month
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-039260-039318 Ok.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-039271-039573 There was a concert and we bought all these CDs.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-039907-039965 Ok.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-039949-040158 We see groups that are not so super famous, but they are good
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-040617-040690 Ok.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-040700-041045 Sometimes we have seen groups
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-040716-040789 And
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-041071-041358 That did not know they were famous and suddenly they're in a festival
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-041666-041744 Yeah.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-041666-041937 We hear a song it is famous
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-041989-042057 Ok.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-041994-042046 But
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-042208-042360 So, you say you play instruments, you and your husband play in a band or group?
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-042918-043048 No. My husband played in a group before. They are not together in that group, they will be together again
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-043831-043899 Okay
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-043841-044186 But no, we don't play for a group, my husband sometimes plays with his friends, but we dont really have time,
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-044859-045166 To compromise ourselves with other people
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-045240-045323 Okay
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-045292-045709 The job doesn't give us time to compromise ourselves that way with a group. If you have a group, you have to practice for at least one day.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-046074-046293 Practice and find that
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-046215-046283 Week
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-046293-046455 The promotions
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-046440-046523 Okay
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-046539-046591 Yeah
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-046653-046966 If you have to dedicate too much time, you can get a group. There's a group that wants to play with my husband.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-047300-047634 But where do they get together, they get together on Wednesdays at night around ten and they practice until like 2 in the morning.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-048219-048605 Does he work, or study? how does he have time for that
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-048563-048620 Yeah, we try, for example, like, knowing who they are before we go to a movie
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-049742-050128 Music, I like music, its good for me
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-050885-051046 I remember songs. lots of songs
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-051255-051323 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-051302-051438 Songs I still sing after years
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-052539-052831 That happens to me whenever i don't listen to a song for a long time, i forget the lyrics
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-053347-053593 She was with her, we listened to a song on the radio I hadn't heard in years, but she remembered the entire song.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-054088-054412 And afterwards they played a song that I hadn't listened to, and it was some four years that I hadn't listened to it, and I knew the song
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-054855-055095 I knew that I knew the song, but I couldn't remember the words to the song. I remembered a little, but not much. To me, if I forget or not
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-055846-056045 I know the song, but I forget the words a little.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-056457-056650 Well, for me, it depends on my mood.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-057224-057417 I have an Ipod. Do you know what Ipods are?
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-057840-057954 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-057954-058132 I have ten thousand songs in the Ipod.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-058518-058612 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-058560-058643 So I have in all, I have a list of music that only has music for the dance music.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-059572-059660 I have a complete list that I use when I go to the gym.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-060558-060652 Exactly
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-060568-060688 I have a list that is music only in Spanish and a list that is only classical music, opera, things like that
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-061612-061836 For relaxation.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-061831-061982 And for studying.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-061883-061935 I have a list to the contrary. For me, to study I can't have that type of music, I can't have classical music, I need music...
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-062650-062733 Yes?
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-062890-063000 That have lyrics because if don't, if there are not lyrics I get bored, I need something to distract me
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-063845-063980 What are you studying?
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-064022-064106 I work with a virus.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-064361-064476 Okay.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-064460-064549 In biology
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-064606-064706 Okay
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-064643-064930 I always need something to distract me, that keeps me alert.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-065233-065373 Exactly.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-065342-065566 Yes, I put music but not classic.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-065833-065958 None
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-065880-066052 I get sleep, I put classic music on when I have to concentrate on writing a report
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-067173-067309 Then, even since I was a little kid always, when I had to study, I always was hearing to music while singing, I could be reading and my dad always criticized that
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-068624-068890 Is impossible for a person to read and sing at the same time but I don't know, it always worked with me I always got good grades
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-069673-069829 I suppose that
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-069886-070069 I had a teacher
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-069923-070022 Not
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-070069-070288 When you are not studying, you can learn it by singing.
20051101_212731_386_fsp-B-071092-071316 Faster than normal
20051101_212731_386_fsp-A-071316-071655 Yes, that doesn't attracts me a little, the music, whatever, can
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-000052-000388 Hello!

20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-003254-003474 None
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-003306-003573 How has your life changed?
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-003613-003712 Okay

20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-003874-003984 A lot of things.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-004222-004511 The best thing you feel has happened in your life.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-004557-004673 None
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-004749-004893 That's a good topic
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-004893-005009 Yes, I met somebody with this kids
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-005362-005472 Yes
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-005420-005855 Everything begins knowing someone.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-005855-006034 Yes, I say the same
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-006011-006214 Kids have not been here.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-006173-006538 The best thing that happened to me was meeting my husband.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-006503-006747 Yes because how
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-006613-006886 Having my kids is the best thing
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-006891-007227 Yes
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-007146-007279 Be healthy and staying healthy
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-007418-007806 Yes because if i had not meet the boy, I wouldn't be here
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-008200-008310 And in reality
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-008223-008478 Another wouldn't have these kids, I wouldn't have known you either
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-008791-008895 Yes
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-008918-009173 If it had not been for
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-009040-009156 Why not? it's good that you find good conversation topics when you talk over here because they also put the music. yesterday there was the music
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-010500-010569 Yes
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-010575-010760 It is entertaining that you talk for twelve minutes and they cut you off.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-011270-011444 I like them
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-011420-011681 Yes they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-011681-011785 None
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-011924-012191 And even though we have twelve minutes to talk about what we want because they are starting to recognize our voices
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-012573-013065 There is no need to talk about what they said.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-012996-013476 We need to talk about what they say or what ever you want, the idea is to talk because that is everything, the entire conversation is recorded
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-013928-014316 That is after the computer knows that.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-014218-014345 Who is who?
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-014409-014611 And for him, his accent.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-014594-014959 The accent, the system, it's the form of speaking.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-014901-015318 None
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-015028-015249 They are invcenting something in the stamps i have
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-015503-015770 Yes, for the
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-015515-015874 They need people that have different voices.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-015949-016366 No idea, I have not called
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-016059-016175 And the
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-016378-016685 Earlier,
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-016656-017021 Yes, the girls all connect using this number
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-017015-017189 Yes
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-017125-017200 Yes they call each other at the same time
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-017513-017756 None
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-017762-018005 And they connect well.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-018185-018538 I'm going to try to call a little later or in the middle of the day.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-018810-019216 I don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-019065-019361 In the same day
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-019297-019378 I don't know I can hear the voices of the beautiful kids
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-019992-020345 Yes i hear them, they're here
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-020102-020449 Yeah, I can hear it very clearly
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-020362-020600 They are both laughing

20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-025250-025355 In english, that's good because they are going to know to different languages.
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-025911-026293 Yeah because, that's how they grow up with two languages.

20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-033515-033909 I speak in Spanish. But the bad thing is when I'm with another person and they speak English
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-034349-034592 I speak to them in English understood
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-034720-034905 But isn't that bad?

20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-065710-066075 Because it cost you a lot, same to find the house
20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-066052-066469 Yes then to put together. I tell you now I still not put curtains they are getting here slowly

20051102_134901_389_fsp-A-069231-069590 The ones in the living dining room because I did not use blinds
20051102_134901_389_fsp-B-070083-070222 You did not use blinds?

20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-003922-004053 Yes, well, of course
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-004053-004271 Not outside of home
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-004225-004544 A lot of work at home.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-004518-004604 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-004604-004680 That's good, and I imagine very happy, right?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-004898-005165 Yes, a little tired now but very happy
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-005160-005368 Yes, your son is four days.

20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-005408-005489 A little.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-005656-005752 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-005732-005828 Why do you live in the United States? Have you lived there your whole life?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-006449-006606 Yes, my parents are from Dominican Republic.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-006778-006849 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-006854-006965 In nineteen seventy something
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-007041-007101 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-007405-007688 I believe it was sixty-three, I am not sure
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-007668-007754 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-007728-007966 A revolution in Santo Domingo.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-007946-008021 OK
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-008016-008183 They went to live in Puerto Rico
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-008325-008416 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-008390-008754 Then they lived there for twenty-ish years.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-008739-008820 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-008825-009305 Then from there, my sister when she went to college came here to the state of Florida then we moved to Miami
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-009654-009755 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-009730-009887 I think I was five years old
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-010058-010160 Very small
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-010160-010443 My sister is older
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-010422-010524 Ok
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-010483-010872 None.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-010862-010923 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-010913-011009 I went to school here and we made a life here
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-011337-011393 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-011575-011646 And
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-011580-012045 You married a Latino or an American?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-012005-012116 An American
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-012111-012227 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-012156-012358 Yes, I met him at University
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-012318-012429 In Miami, I suppose.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-012778-013041 No, I went to
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-013010-013096 Ok
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-013081-013208 In
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-013182-013248 OK
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-013233-013425 I met him there
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-013385-013637 Very good.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-013587-013698 Then
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-013738-013809 And
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-013743-013910 After
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-013814-014446 What language do you speak with your children?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-014461-014582 Well
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-014471-014699 He is twenty four months.  The other, no.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-014704-015042 She is twenty-three months and the other is four days old
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-014916-014982 Twenty three, yes. no it is
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-015063-015533 What we do here when he and my husband are not at home
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-015513-015563 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-015568-015806 I speak in Spanish to my daughter
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-015806-015882 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-015882-016220 So then when he's here we speak completely in English
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-016205-016321 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-016276-016574 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-016554-016680 Recognize them.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-016685-017059 I was surprised because many times she said things.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-017206-017297 Oh, yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-017256-017383 I had not even realized that she had already learned.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-017560-017651 Oh, really
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-017666-017974 It could be in English or in Spanish
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-017716-017767 Wow
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-018025-018197 She's already learning
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-018151-018278 Very fast
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-018262-018323 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-018298-018727 Also, at what age do kids start talking normally, I really don't know.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-018379-018419 And I think she was, let's say sixteen months
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-019324-019390 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-019369-019587 Since she's learning English and Spanish
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-019551-019637 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-019632-019860 You take the kids that take a little more time to talk
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-019895-019941 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-020133-020289 So I picked up my little girl and her friends.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-020633-020704 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-020694-021063 She needs to speak louder than she is
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-021032-021118 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-021123-021315 Until recently
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-021315-021411 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-021346-021760 I knew she could speak and understand it.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-021760-021871 Yes.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-021796-022114 But he had to learn the language that was a little more difficult
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-022064-022134 Of course, it is much more difficult, but I believe it will be good in the long run but not very good, so far with the language is an advantage
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-022741-022817 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-023080-023160 The truth
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-023171-023347 I know that she understood.,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-023747-023812 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-023762-024060 What I was saying in English and Spanish
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-024035-024106 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-024146-024727 I know that she understands me because when she doesn't know how to do something it makes her feel dumb
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-024899-024960 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-024914-025294 I see her little face and I know she understands me.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-025208-025551 Yes, of course, but children are very clever, and then, no
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-025420-025506 Yes.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-025637-025713 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-025713-026092 She understands it. She speaks it.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-026082-026148 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-026153-026320 And
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-026289-026603 I hope she stays like that, because then when she's growing, and a lot of her friends speak English, she's going to practice English more
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-027351-027856 Yes, we're not going to send her to school, we're going to home-school her
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-027831-027917 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-027892-028089 Because I was a teacher
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-028084-028235 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-028155-028534 I think that instead of teaching other's kids, I should stay home.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-028973-029049 Yeah
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-028989-029171 And I can teach my own children
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-029171-029287 Yes, that's true
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-029287-029413 So
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-029332-029570 What do you think about her not having school mates?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-029883-029949 Well
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-029949-030141 That's also not an experience, bone
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-030166-030652 Yes, there are many programs here in Miami for people who teach their children at home
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-030909-030990 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-030975-031395 Then, usually once a week, they will be together
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-031526-031612 Ok
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-031541-031930 Then it's school. They have a class they'll have to teach in English or at the University, but as a school that meets once a week
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-032795-032957 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-032921-033315 I have many friends and family who have done that
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-033684-033786 The
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-033770-034053 I don't have any problems
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-034069-034160 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-034180-034468 Also not something that
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-034235-034311 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-034478-034827 Because that worries me too and I want her to have lots of friends
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-034882-035115 What I was thinking, is that part of the experience is to be in school with people you know.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-035262-035378 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-035631-036308 When you're a kid, have true friends is very important
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-036308-036449 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-036424-036510 I don't think so
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-036510-036636 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-036621-037142 As long as she has contact with other people at least once a week.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-037157-037445 Also you knowthey have the sports in palces in the community
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-037743-038077 Yes, there's a lot of contribution from the community
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-038072-038491 Yes, so thing like that is how they socialize
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-038790-038946 Yes.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-038962-039128 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-039123-039366 It is not common for it to happen in Mexico.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-039674-039740 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-039967-040144 I don't know anyone who has come out from that type of school. I've always been very curious about how they do it here in the United States. I do know is much more common
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-041165-041398 That come from home schooling before now I don't know
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-041711-041858 Yes, like any other experience, it's how you take it, it can be good or bad
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-042358-042434 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-042601-042823 How the schools are here, also how the kids are
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-043132-043359 It can be very bad also, right
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-043354-043506 Yes, that also I would like for her to have friends and all those things, but at the same time I think I have to protect her
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-044117-044527 Yes, but you have to be careful because it is bad to overprotect them.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-044517-044613 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-044618-044739 It can be very bad
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-044739-045088 I want to teach her because I can teach her anything
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-045558-045614 Yes.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-045568-045669 You know
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-045664-045735 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-045689-046033 It's a little different than what they show you in school.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-046038-046134 Yes, true. Until what grade will you homeschool her?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-046397-046630 I don't know. I haven't given it much thought since she's only two years old.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-046983-047120 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-047034-047191 And I haven't started
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-047135-047352 We will see
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-047211-047342 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-047454-047737 Are you planning to teach him the whole elementary grades
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-047949-048171 It would probably be until sixth grade
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-048424-048500 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-048495-048758 I can teach her up to High School
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-049324-049410 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-049445-049516 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-049491-049905 You've taught classes up to high schoot?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-049865-050057 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-049946-049991 Which subjects?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-050198-050603 I was a special education teacher.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-050593-050668 Yeah
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-050658-050825 I taught everything.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-050820-050977 Okay, I understand.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-050941-051366 So now you know, the only thing is that, if you don't agree I won't do it.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-051361-051437 Yep.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-051371-051882 If I don't understand the topic I teach it to myself, and then I am able to teach it to the kids.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-051851-052023 Alright, OK I see
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-052023-052266 So you know how are we going to say algebra.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-052483-052549 No
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-052513-052943 It's not that I don't know it but I could forget it.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-052933-053024 If
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-052958-053095 I don't have time before.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-053090-053181 Yep
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-053115-053292 So, before I started the class I remembered everything.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-053802-053914 No
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-053893-054136 What is it that i had to do
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-054111-054227 Yes, of course.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-054212-054454 So I could teach them
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-054470-054606 Okay.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-054520-055026 It's not that hard for me.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-055051-055258 I said in high school the subjects kind of get more specialized like chemistry is more advanced and physics is more advanced.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-056239-056512 Likely this time, I know that now
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-056522-056608 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-056532-057063 They have classes for kids that can solve them on the computer.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-057088-057154 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-057093-057427 They can go to high school
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-057417-057502 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-057513-057775 There are many options
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-057831-057912 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-058033-058200 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-058261-058347 Yes, no.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-058276-058488 To register the (person!?) in a public school
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-058498-058584 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-058544-058751 Do you know these universities?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-058741-058832 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-058807-059246 Have high school classes for kids that can be taken in the University.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-059221-059388 Yes, I heard about that
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-059413-059620 Therefore, we have many options.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-059524-059631 Good luck.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-059848-059898 And
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-060000-060323 But like you say it, but he's barely two years old and right now there's no need to think a lot about this.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-060591-060712 No, my husband says that I'm a teacher.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-060990-061091 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-061041-061369 I'm always reading her books, singing her songs
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-061637-061708 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-061663-061890 She's having fun but at the same time, she's learning something
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-062446-062532 Yes, okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-062572-062658 I'm not giving her formal schooling.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-062941-063058 Okay
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-063012-063285 I'm teaching her.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-063265-063361 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-063285-063447 Little by little, she already knows the alphabet. Well she knows the song
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-063806-063952 Yes, she reads
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-063912-064230 Yes, so she already knows the numbers
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-064225-064311 Yes,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-064251-064579 A little. If I tell her one, she can tell me two, three. She already knows that eight comes after seven.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-065155-065332 Yes, she already knows the order.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-065317-065605 Little by little.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-065464-065550 Yes, that's good.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-065706-065797 So you know,
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-065949-066207 Yes, sounds very interesting.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-066242-066328 Yes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-066293-066525 I don't know anything, I don't know I mean if I was in that situation, I don't know how I would do it because I could never imagine how
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-067046-067233 I can't give my son classes because I don't have an education.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-068304-068380 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-068350-068588 I imagine you must have studied something like Education?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-068800-068886 Well
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-068825-068931 What did you study?
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-068941-069401 I studied education but they didn't exactly teach me how to teach a kid to read
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-069735-069846 Yes, no
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-069745-070109 I had to learn all those things when I was working.
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-070124-070200 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-070165-070433 I am using the experience
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-070438-070650 All the schools gave classes
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-070695-070751 Yes, but for that reason, for me to do it with my son
20051102_180402_391_fsp-A-071408-071484 None
20051102_180402_391_fsp-B-071474-071823 Is not a problem because I already have the experience
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-000034-000191 My name is Mariza.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-000228-000520 Hello, good afternoon. My name is Lorena. I am here in San Antonio, Texas
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-000811-000922 Hello
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-000957-001047 Hello, well today's topic is very moving.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-001567-002032 Yes, it has also been hard for me to think abut which one is better
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-002046-002809 Exactly. Now I said memories are precisely the most important thing that can happen in life because you live off of memories, no?
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-003142-003919 Exactly, with so much and I don't know the more time goes by, more memories there are, I don't know, I wouldn't know which one to choose to start with
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-003967-004085 None
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-003974-004134 For example the best
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-004175-004411 Hat's how it is, I am a mom
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-004522-004841 Yes me too
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-004640-004904 And maybe I would like to think about the best that has happened to me, maybe that it is to have had my children.  I remember that at that moment in which I was having him I said, this is the best that has happened my while life
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-006450-006582 Of course.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-006554-006755 I want to be consistent with this comment that I made to myself at the moment.  Something has happened, but there must also be other things
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-007639-008078 You cannot stop with one.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-008053-008233 Of course that is what I was thinking and I asked, had that not happened, how your life would have been different. In your case, not having had your children
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-009329-009704 Yes, I wouldn't have like it
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-009593-009877 It is
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-009717-010078 Now they are bigger they have given me so many beautiful things, that maybe by myself it wouldn't have been enough to get so many memories
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-011354-011778 Positive and negative emotions, not everything is beautiful, I have a son who has a health problem and that is also very painful, no
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-012873-012978 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-012964-013075 Emotions are more like love and more tender and the husband is there
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-014115-014289 Yes, and it's that no yes but the children
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-014517-014878 That has a lot to do
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-014732-014878 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-014892-015232 No, not in one's life.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-014899-014975 No
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-015246-015724 I would think that it can't be just one event
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-015745-015939 Sure,
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-015808-016265 A painful event or memory like the death of my mother.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-016591-017216 Yes, the death of a family member or a loved one has to be the worst that can happen to someone
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-017160-017597 Yes or a son's illness
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-017493-017771 Also
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-017625-017979 It's very painful, but it's nice to try to think about it
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-018561-019664 Sure like the second part of my question, it was that what would have been of your life if not, if that had not happened, that negative or painful event
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-019692-019845 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-019824-020178 It wouldn't be, that person would be now still. For example in my case, my mom is alive, but my grandparents died a long time ago
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-020857-021156 I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because I lived far away
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-022342-022473 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-022363-022709 Exactly
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-022515-022820 Sure, life would be pretty different
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-022800-023160 Your husband, where did you meet him?
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-023167-023514 Here in the UNited States, almost by chance
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-023542-023812 Because you are from Spain
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-023576-023667 I'm from Spain
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-023840-024062 None
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-024006-024409 I came here to study but I met him and ended up staying for twelve years
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-024804-024964 None
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-024957-025255 I have a five year old girl, she is still very young and I still have some time
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-025900-026233 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-025969-026191 Nothing. It's different when kids are older and become more independent.  I still have to go through that.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-026989-027489 Yes, and there's so many phases.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-027052-027204 And sure,
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-027495-028064 But at this age, the kids are more loving
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-027565-027759 Yes, everybody says that
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-028231-028612 It's a very loving phase, and well, when they grow up they go out and do their own things. For example, that's nice too, but you don't get as much love as you used to.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-029239-029942 Now, mom, I had a good time, and this is more like a conversation, like a different level
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-029942-030357 And they don't depend on you that much, they are not that close
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-030110-030215 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-030401-030696 It's really nice. What is the best thing that has happened to you, your best memory
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-031269-032046 Well I believe the same like you, to have children, well I only have one and I don't know if I'll have more
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-031657-031741 Okay
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-032073-032434 Was not, not I mean I don't believe I was ready to being mother maybe because it was a big change and oh the pregnancy was really hard and the, oh
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-033315-034006 The, we have raised her, my husband and I here both alone, then it was a little bit difficult but also was of course to have a kid change your life, then so it is the best that have happened to me I say
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-034510-034602 Until now
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-034529-034647 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-034644-034891 It can be compare with anything that's what I say
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-034904-035632 Yes it's the twenty five or twenty four, I don't remember.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-035986-036152 Of course
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-036062-036471 A person, in the sports in or in the academic life or in the work, no
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-036818-037769 Of course and the other questions was what could be different if I have not lived that maybe have not being mother well my life would be very different
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-037769-038032 I had finished the studies too,
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-037775-037886 Right, exactly.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-038082-038291 Got a more important career, or had to travel more, or met some other person. You never know. You can only imagine.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-039003-039530 Exactly, however you go accumulating.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-039154-039214 Yes but
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-039558-039662 Memories in Christmas pictures, and in the high school festivals pictures, and in the kids sports, festival pictures.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-039877-040043 None
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-040682-041278 It is precisely, putting together this life because it is like it was made of memories
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-041223-042013 Exactly yes, I have thousands and thousands of pictures, all of them are of, of my are all are of my daughter, that's because, the
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-042034-042978 It's easy to say what is most important because without that, I don't know. I traveled a lot, met interesting people you can't compare with
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-043012-043200 With the children I guess
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-043054-043144 Yes because you don't study to become a mother
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-043789-044184 No
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-044053-044386 The human being doesn't study how to love but finally the emotion is more profound and complete
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-044913-045690 Yes, i was saying to my sister she doesn't have any children and i say to her, until you become a mother you would not know how is like being a woman
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-045704-046057 20 years married no, they don't have any children and i don't think they will and then it's difficult to explain
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-046800-047042 It is difficult to explain
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-046904-047216 It's difficult to explain
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-047126-047625 But the expedition and those huge cars and that spend like that, you know? it can only run like around twenty miles, eighteen miles per gallon something like that, that is a huge expense
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-047653-047909 Yes, I had him because at the age of thirty, it was the best time to have one and not at old age.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-048665-049102 To raise a child you have to have a lot of patience and energy
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-049040-049512 Lots of energy, indeed
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-049130-049526 My daughter requries a lot of patience and sacrifice
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-049914-050018 None
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-050011-050164 And
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-050080-050691 Yes, actually for example she, because she's very playful
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-050510-051031 She's very active, more like hyper-active not like me when i was a child, i was lot more quiet and did all my fathers said, she is a lot more
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-051932-052279 She is more like three, sometimes is
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-052265-052473 Yes.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-052279-053063 At the end of the day, i'm exhausted, but that's what parenting is all about
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-052716-052883 That's how it is, yes,
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-053084-053181 And
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-053250-053798 And this now I understand a lot because they are that way and everything they permit to happen because they have a strong and active character
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-054423-054908 Should I wait for her
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-054804-055089 She will achieve many things.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-055047-056073 Yes, if I compare her to my niece, they are so difficult. I think that my daughter has a stronger character. That will help her in the future to get ahead.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-055949-056490 Yes, with all the difficult things that will confront her
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-056497-056635 Clearly
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-056524-056968 No, my youngest daughter is really good in her studies as well as in sports.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-057537-057863 Yes we want my daughter to also practice a sport but we want to wait until she's a bit older because she's just five years old maybe she's much too young
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-058557-058952 She has the body to become a sportsperson. Perhaps that will help her develop more.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-058987-059306 Perhaps her character could too
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-059195-059313 Yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-059341-059576 Also guide.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-059396-059694 Perhaps calm her
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-059618-060069 And that she can get tired
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-059729-060270 Yes I need this because sometimes we go to sleep before her, we can't continue like this
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-060235-060610 Yes, she needs to get tired, what ridiculousness
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-060291-060450 They tell me that it's the age
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-060672-060846 Where do you live?
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-060825-061102 We are living in Philadelphia right now.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-061047-061616 I have my oldest daughter studying at the University of Pennsylvania in Philidelphia.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-061539-061664 What a coincidence, it is a good university
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-061720-061824 Yes it in in Philidelphia.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-062427-062802 Yes.  Here is a city where many people come to study.  That is another important thing, education.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-063357-063551 And yeah.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-063378-063454 Yeah, oh, yes, besides, for example we have found movies that are for children, or rather, they are not for children but when
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-063551-063856 I would like my daughter to go to the University but I am still many years away from that.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-064127-064453 Yes she will do it; what did you study?
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-064460-065001 Psychology, but I did not finish the degree.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-065015-065209 Aha.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-065084-065778 After I was pregnant, we wanted to raise the girl at home. We did not want to take her to day care because we felt that it's the traditional form that I was raised. I was with my parents, they took care of me.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-066409-066554 None
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-066457-066804 We did not want to leave her alone in daycare.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-066763-066998 That is a good decision.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-066957-067213 It is good
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-067102-068011 I support her, I have to take a lot of vitamins to have the necessary energy
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-067248-067630 Yes, while it is possibel, and now, yes
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-068039-068282 Now you will see how quickly time passes. I celebrated my youngest daughter's fifteenth birthday yesterday.
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-068823-068927 Wow
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-068850-069197 And now when you look back you will have many more memories of what she did, that will be yours because
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-070231-070779 They achieve great things thanks to the support that parents can give. Form what is given, not saying that you leave to one side
20051102_181501_393_fsp-A-071271-071667 Maybe your thing is more personal, your career, your profession
20051102_181501_393_fsp-B-071549-071722 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-000007-000327 Well, my name is Claudia Ivette. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-000341-000505 My name is Juan.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-000576-000733 It's a pleasure, Juan
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-000718-000946 The pleasure is all mine. Where are you?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-000868-001074 Excuse me?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-001081-001209 Where are you?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-001209-001459 I'm in Idaho.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-001473-001544 Yeah
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-001494-001743 In a place called Robert, and where are you speaking from?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-001800-001928 I'm in Texas, San Antonio
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-002306-002647 A little far away.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-002462-002911 Of course
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-002704-002811 Yes.  We get the subject of the movies.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-003551-003679 No, yes...
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-003580-003953 Well, I don't, about the ratings I don't understand a lot, I know that there are movies that are, PG thirteen, PG
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-004597-004718 Yeah
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-004775-005003 And actually I've seen some that have more swear words that are PG they're like more violent and more
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-005800-006007 The PGs are more like that, the PGs than the PG thirteens, I've noticed
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-006355-006441 Yes.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-006590-007124 I don't understand a lot of that
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-006647-006982 I haven't taken into consideration those classifications
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-007629-007722 OK
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-007637-007871 I can't understand them very well
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-007871-007943 OK
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-007921-008597 They are complicated, they should have more information about what they have
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-008576-008825 Yeah, i would have loved to learned how to play an instrument, but I'm horrible at that stuff
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-008654-008725 I no longer have little children.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-009145-009281 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-009238-009466 Children, well, i don't worry too much
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-009459-009558 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-009508-009679 About those classifications; however, i worry because when we go to see a movie that's worthy, that's interesting and not just any movie, then the classification...
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-010583-010704 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-010932-011530 I'm not so interested in that as much as i am in the quality and the comments i hear about the movies, right?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-011124-011644 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-011615-011957 That's it, that's what I'm interested about, I don't know if you do the same, if you always go alone or if you with someone
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-012583-013030 No, I'm married, I've been married for three years and i do have a kid, he's 20 months old
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-013473-013608 Right.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-013531-013736 My husband is more concerned about him turning two years old.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-014376-014726 F we watch a movie and we really love it, ~PG or ~PG 13
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-015209-015316 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-015252-015814 We don't really like to watch adult movies or those that
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-015850-015935 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-015935-016085 Up to PG13
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-016113-016241 Yes.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-016128-016761 Those, or at times one that is R, but the truth is that I don't pay attention, for example if there is a movie that we like
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-016832-016967 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-017167-017387 We buy it and sometimes it has nude scenes. My husband grabs the movie and erases that part.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-018241-018348 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-018263-018434 And we do it mostly because, for example, there are times when neither my husband nor me are going to be there. So then the children might grab the movie and could watch it.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-019215-019678 So for that my husband will record some commercial or other thing.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-019224-019323 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-019678-020251 They can watch the movie, it will be purely cars or action.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-020291-020434 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-020302-020711 If you take away the part that is a bit pornographic, because you always see that, even though it's a good movie it always has to have some nudity.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-021138-021202 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-021395-021629 At times it has nothing to do with it, but
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-021395-021565 There is always something
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-021629-022391 We have movies that are about action of cars.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-022284-022533 Yes, it has nothing to do with it, yes.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-022455-022782 We are going to have other children and once in a while they will be alone and we don't have to worry that they are going to watch a movie
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-023750-024099 There will be no problem
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-023829-023935 I believe you might be right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-024391-024476 Yes,
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-024427-024676 Look at that very curiously
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-024953-025053 Yeah,
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-024996-025501 What worries me the most in the movies is language and violence.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-025409-025501 Oh, yes, because it really
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-025629-025750 Generally, when there is an exaggeration in language
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-026163-026291 Yes,
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-026249-026761 Or in violence, everything else is the same
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-026790-026903 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-026861-027117 So if a movie is rated R it will have scenes of all types.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-027551-027686 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-027580-028092 Those are free. R appear more than restricted. If you don't have much information about the movie, it's exaggerated on all levels.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-028362-028533 Right.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-029857-030035 Is for children of thirteen years of age, can see it butsometimes they say vocabulary and sometimes they show scenes.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-031195-031601 Of nudity and that, so then, I say, since they will be watching, well
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-031380-031516 Yes,
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-031615-031893 I am Mexican
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-031907-032042 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-031943-032277 Still on television
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-033188-033451 Look at that
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-033295-033693 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-033530-033665 Making memory of the movies we have gone to see lately, they are all
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-033736-033857 Very fast
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-034234-034768 PG-13 or something like that. I don't know where to hold it because the ones we have around here.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-034384-034491 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-034804-035017 Available in theaters. Right?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-034953-035088 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-035024-035295 They are not really good.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-035330-035544 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-035387-035686 Then no, let's not worry much abouth that information because my kids are already teenagers we always go to the theater all together
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-035992-036099 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-036277-036626 We always go for the quality of the movie more than anything else.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-036597-036704 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-036725-037117 The classification they have to oriented us about the movies, it really does not give us much information, no
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-037651-038192 Sometimes, it does not say anything, but sometimes it says, for example
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-037736-037900 We don't take it into consideration.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-038206-038697 And it changes for example and when you are watching it, it's different to what it told you
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-038733-038818 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-038975-039523 Yes, for example, it says something like it has too much violence and then it's not that violent, or sometimes it is or not, it doesn't clearly state the information
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-039870-040057 So, sometimes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-040035-040156 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-040057-040287 You don't even pay attention to it because, for example
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-040334-040562 Yes, no
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-040569-040782 Those things that they sell, for example, TV sets, you see
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-041473-041665 What
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-041518-041821 They remove or block bad words.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-042617-042836 One of my friends says they don't work proper because sometimes they block words that are not cuss words, and really bad cuss words are not blocked.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-043907-043964 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-044038-044295 So
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-044049-044569 That's when I think we should be involved in the education of our children
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-044519-044633 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-044661-045153 We never done any acts of censorship we
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-045081-045188 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-045209-045793 We've tried to discuss or talk about the issue when we see strong scenes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-045814-045900 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-045871-046220 We discussed it with them and said, Hey, that was really unnecessary, they could've cut it out of the film, that was rude.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-046654-046697 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-047110-047195 No, we analyze it and so we take advantage of it as a way to educate our kids.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-047765-047879 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-047772-048078 It generally works for us really good.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-048384-048455 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-048412-049010 He has good common sense about which movies to watch
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-049103-049514 Yes, that's a great idea. I remember when my mom would watch a movie with me and we would always watch them after ten in the evening because
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-050211-050569 We knew that we were always going to find
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-050234-050334 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-050569-050852 My mom would get ugly movies.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-050875-050989 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-050878-051302 The ones that are not made for children, if they were airing a movie that had bad language
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-051330-051523 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-051836-052420 My mom said, when we were kids, it is not nudity; however, with little clothes on.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-052491-052612 None
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-052824-053311 You can watch it. You will understand more.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-053067-053188 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-053336-053828 Because when you say, Turn around. Look away. You are not supposed to see that, you are telling them to do so. Teenagers will because they are wondering why their mom told them not to.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-054491-054583 Sure
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-054705-055097 If the movie is playing on the television, they wonder why they are not allowed to watch it
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-055245-055323 They are going to find out about those things in the end. They are going to have opportunities to see all those things.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-055459-055620 Yes. yes.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-056028-056519 Yes it is that censure or the nformation that should be censured
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-057010-057138 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-057110-057665 That type of thing I have never thought of it as good because
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-057580-057850 No, yes, I believe that.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-057701-057765 There is to much information about the movies and it would be convenient to go and see it with your family
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-058291-058469 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-058348-058944 We are together after we informed ourselves what the movie was about.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-059572-059729 Yes, it's true.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-059743-060014 Because the restrictions that they put, there is too much violence found in cartoons
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-060697-060846 Yea,
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-060725-061188 There are cartoons for children  has exaggerated violence
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-061145-061572 Is that shown during the day?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-061558-061715 Yeah, fundamentalism, yes, from the right wing, But also the country is the party has the power so, everyone from the president to everyone who is into this, at the White House, they're all rightwing republicans.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-062590-062825 Yes, right?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-062597-062754 No, and of the other maybe, less than five percent are worth watching
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-063537-063736 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-063608-063985 No, but with those, you have enough to have an idea of what you must be looking for, right?
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-064362-064441 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-064377-064825 There are enough, it does not mean that not enough movies are not made, but so many are made, you don't have to see them all.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-065024-065145 That's true.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-065174-065352 Then
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-065238-065423 That's true
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-065373-065637 I am working with the parents of the deaf children.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-066263-066405 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-066377-066818 That was about the critics towards the movie and then we went.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-066811-066967 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-066861-067295 That's what we always look for, we go to see this movie
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-067274-067402 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-067316-067907 We've already made a decision about what movies. Since my kids were little, they've had that education because he likes the movies a lot.My wife and I love the movies.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-068626-068740 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-068725-069167 Never, even when they were little.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-069138-069231 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-069238-069693 If there was a movie, sometimes we took them even if it was for older people.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-069871-069971 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-070000-070355 Maybe there could be some scenes a little stronger, but one scene doesn't necessarily make the movie.
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-070690-070846 Right
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-070775-071124 We tried to talk about the message about a lot of war movies
20051103_211105_404_fsp-B-071402-071565 Yes
20051103_211105_404_fsp-A-071551-071758 A lot of war movies are, for example, Saving Private Ryan.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-000000-000215 Good evening.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-000000-000120 Good evening, I am Joe
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-000365-000467 What is your name?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-000453-000567 Joe
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-000575-000701 Joe?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-000586-000858 What is your name?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-000743-000887 Alex.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-000876-001051 Alex, where are you from?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-000995-001300 I am here in Los Angeles, I think we've spoken about religion before.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-001510-001885 Oh, yes, of course I rememeber.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-001756-001984 We talked on the fourth of October. It's been some time now.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-002126-002374 What a memory, yes I remember, how couldn't I.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-002541-002763 Where are you from again?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-002652-002815 I am from Denver , Colorado.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-002913-003050 Oh, yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-003208-003504 What do you think about tonight's topic?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-003530-003752 I watch television by quality not by classifications.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-004598-004815 Yes, I don't pay attention to the classification apart from I am at an adult stage and have a little girl
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-005504-005722 Always keeping an eye on what they watch. i don't want her to watch programs that will give her nightmares or will give her bad motivations. There are a lot
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-006622-006845 The movies out there are more violent.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-007504-007800 Enough to classify because they are making very violent movies with lots of topics
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-008277-008493 Yes, no, I think I am interested in movies and television through the topics they have
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-009558-009679 Yes
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-009662-009806 Now if it is violent but does not have quality, it is not a good movie. But if it has some violence but it is teaching us something
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-010759-011124 Like a documentary or something from life, then it has value
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-011280-011389 Sure
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-011340-011670 One cannot deny the truth of life
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-011661-011788 Sure
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-011682-012077 One cannot live life with blind eyes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-012072-012549 The movie is about the allies side during the Iraq War and the soldier's experiences
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-013305-013661 This one with the colored actor, his name is Jamie, I think it is Jamie foxx.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-013900-014151 Yes
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-014000-014362 Here's is another white boy that looks traumatized when he is experimenting in Irak. Those things are very real and they happen every day there
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-015206-015710 And those movies may be also a political critique
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-015280-015365 Yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-015710-015974 Maybe the Bush Administration has always been obsessed with war.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-016350-016513 Yes
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-016405-016795 Mistrusting the public with Iraq.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-016700-017051 Yes, transfering many things from outside of the lie he told in order to invade Iraq that is really, now one looks and really no, no
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-017957-018187 It is not worthy to do that. More than one thousand soldiers already died.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-018563-019042 Those movies are important as the majority of the people are ignorant of the things that happen in life
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-019444-019702 You don't have information
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-019788-020000 Yes, it's true
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-019900-020199 The information we get is all propaganda, it's important to see other versions of what happens in the world
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-021371-021516 Yes its true. I think that movie classification today is rather relative. I know they have from thirteen, they clearly know that X are
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-022441-022531 Obvious, true? But I think that these days is well beyond what is permitted or not. That I agree with.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-023589-023776 Allot of moves dont make sense
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-024713-024851 None
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-024749-024924 They need to see the violence
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-024905-025174 Those movies are bad
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-025087-025262 Yes, very bad
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-025228-025480 Because they show the violence
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-025432-025752 And it glorifies it some way
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-025768-026229 Yes, they don't do it for the value, just to sell.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-025782-025921 That isn't for selling to
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-026253-026481 Certain people's
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-026459-026658 Boys copy their heros
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-027885-028066 Those shows, and movies are corrupting the young, teach them fake values
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-029226-029552 Society, the parents, the family has a lot to do to make them understand how to treat them, true? My daughter, I don't, when
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-030441-030604 I see something and I don't want her to see it. I don't force her in such a manner, saying don't watch that
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-031238-031510 I try in an educational way to teach her why this program is not good for her instead of imposing it by force.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-032157-032487 I have a fourteen year old son.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-032598-032676 None
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-032661-032931 And every time he comes to visit me, I have to set the control on the sex channels.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-033262-033389 Oh, yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-033374-033644 Yes, because he's obsessed with that, because when I leave I go to work and he watches that.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-034211-034465 Is easy
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-034237-034405 So I have had to control him, he can't do it anymroe because I already have it controlled. BUt I have it controlled because I took the step to control it.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-035335-035419 Yes,
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-035358-035652 It is the job of each mom and dad to control the television that their kids are going to watch
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-036658-036839 Yes, exactly.  In my house I have basic cable so there's no channel that crosses the line.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-037774-038079 Do you have teenagers?
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-037963-038132 No, my daughter is only five years old.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-038361-038619 A girl.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-038477-038706 A Disney channel that she loves to watch and also we watch the discovery channel
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-039474-039709 Comedy program we watch together.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-040429-040646 I don't let her watch things that's not suitable
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-041407-041691 They make those things interesting when it is not morally or socially correct.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-042107-042449 Yes, you can teach your kids but, the truth is that you as a parent should not have your eyes closed, especially when
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-043252-043408 They are going to have more temptations than what we had.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-043788-043969 Yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-043882-044409 No because we are not good fathers according to culture.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-044386-044598 Which culture is more
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-044415-044763 Because today's teenage culture involves gangs, hip hop music, a lot of sex and a lot of violence.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-045951-046102 The videos
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-046075-046285 The videos
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-046272-046620 Yes, all of these things
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-046369-046717 It's not easy to control everything that you try and one, I try to explain the consequences if you do this.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-047382-047556 Yes, he does, if he has sex with a girl there are consequences, that can occur, what can happen? I'd like to understand.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-048340-048502 Yes
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-048449-048857 One has to continuously talk to them about the things the parents see, because I am a substitute teacher in the school
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-049323-049539 Yes
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-049468-049666 They care a lot about the boys when they are five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten years old but when they are thinking they need help the parents are not there.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-050673-050883 We begin to fail and these boys have a lot of temptation.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-051265-051571 The teenage years are critical.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-051434-051716 It's the teenage years where they start to do more than a boy would in life.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-051936-052098 Exactly
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-052039-052369 Not only when he is five or six years old
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-052362-052811 They say we were teenagers, I remember how I was in those years
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-053207-053585 I had my rebellious spirit and all these things but it's when parental guidance is most necessary.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-053874-054059 Exactly. Then all depends on the education from the fathers, the way they're into the young ones' lives no, no the, not the clarifications
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-055474-055792 The classification is just a number.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-055742-055838 Yes. And if anyone comes to see, it's like when they're all alone with their friends. They can see whatever they want because there is nobody to forbid them to do it
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-056835-056943 Yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-056839-057343 If anybody helps him by taking him the good way in, That helps a lot to reason before doing
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-058032-058392 To make a wrong choice
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-058201-058555 We must give the boys a basis, what's good and what's wrong, not only when they are five or six years old but when they're fifteen, sixteen, eighteen years old
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-059375-059555 Exactly
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-059562-059982 And it is more important when they're fifteen than when they're five, because when they're five they're going to follow the easy rules
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-060268-060412 Yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-060347-060827 When they're fifteen, that's another story.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-060759-060927 They believe themselves more independents, that they don't need their parents anymore
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-061144-061606 They already have friends.  They're already involved in culture.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-061563-061700 Yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-061606-062061 Mom or dad must go to work, they do not have always time
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-062252-062809 Young people influence nowadays is pretty big. I was influenced by my friends when I was younger.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-063541-063948 I can see that technologies and such things are greater. Because really the movies, back in time when I was a boy weren't as violent as they are now
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-064703-065015 There wasn't video games, and television was more restricted, not all that modern violence like blood, and bodies shown like on CSI.  All those shows are pretty graphic.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-066232-066514 That show things like if they were real
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-066437-066611 None
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-066514-066855 Young people get used to watching that as acceptable. When I was growing up, if those things were shown, it would have been chaos!
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-067916-068252 In fact, it wouldn't have been allowed at all, but it's true, times are changing and that's why, young people are influenced by it
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-069007-069199 These things are acceptable in our society in a negative way.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-069596-069866 Yes.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-069804-070032 I hope that when my girl gets to that age, becomes a teenager
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-070423-070681 Now thats going to be in a very little time, my friend.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-070644-070865 Yes, time flies.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-B-070681-070909 Time flies.
20051103_233456_406_fsp-A-070865-071075 I remember when she used to be a little baby and now she's jumping, running everywhere, learning lots of new things, being curious and asking lots of questions.

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-002661-002987 Now we are living a very critical moment with the United States and our new president
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-003364-003449 Yes.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-003549-003906 And then mom
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-003851-004132 Yes, what I have to say about the United States is not very positive either
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-004564-004920 Wow,
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-004805-005166 The United States which is, what
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-005071-005276 It is strong.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-005201-005347 It's very
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-005276-005467 Strong, and even, I don't know if you for some chance of life you have this, knowledge of a page that's called TV For All
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-006351-006652 There you can see the television channels
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-006356-006482 No.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-006652-006969 All the countries of the world including Spain.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-006953-007059 Yes.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-007014-007265 It's called a TV.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-007481-007616 TV for all
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-007651-007867 Four and all like television for everyone, something like that.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-008174-008369 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-008304-008630 We have been looking for a particular channel from Venezuela.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-009062-009193 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-009148-009374 English in fact is a
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-009926-010051 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-009986-010192 And then now we can really see the truth, what is that which is happening this, that which never was said and especially with our president who is a person very
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-011221-011583 As we say in Venezuela, clear and rough
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-011502-011653 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-011603-011959 I don't know if you've had the opportunity to hear him.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-011954-012145 Yes, on television after the Summits of the Americas.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-012828-013164 Exactly
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-012938-013044 They air it here in Philadelphia. You have various Hispanic channels like Telemundo, Univision.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-013561-013747 Same
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-013636-013847 Galavision and all that
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-013787-013928 SAME AS HERE
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-013877-014108 And you hear it all, yes, and
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-014043-014334 All those people air whatever they want
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-014475-014861 Here we have Government control.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-014761-014982 Correct.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-014861-015218 We only hear that no-, what they want us to hear
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-015087-015243 Correct, and they put, sometimes they twist
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-015620-015820 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-015660-015936 They twist what is happening. I always meet people that say damn you, what do you have to say about that crazy guy you have as president?
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-016634-016880 Mother I totally agree they truly touch the spot.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-017533-017874 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-017794-017949 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-017874-018155 I try to have patience, because it's a delicate issue.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-018507-018587 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-018512-018878 I didn't have any, including with some Venezuela people
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-019174-019280 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-019184-019405 People that have lots of years here and lack the knowledge about what really happens there
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-019772-019907 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-019837-020148 And besides that, they are afraid of the idea that they have been slfd, that communism, that I don't know what that Fidel and that this and that and
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-020630-020876 The situation that we are living in Venezuela is a very special situation.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-021484-021605 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-021519-021830 It is distinctive to Venezuela, not related to the Cuban reality.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-022398-022629 Had to adopt that system, which were the necessities that got them to assume that system
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-023322-023608 They were applying it because evidently there were mistakes in everything. Just like how we have mistakes right now.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-023775-023866 Of course, yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-023994-024336 We have been making mistakes, however, it is being work on function of that, like the president says, clearly he has a claim against
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-024953-025164 The government, not against the the country but against the government from here that they are the ones that they
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-025415-025541 Of course.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-025752-025897 They assume some politics best
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-026294-026781 Yes, that I mean no, has been don, in reality, like the question says, the world's police, they are the ones that pretend to be
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-026600-026831 Exactly
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-026781-027072 They tell you what is going to happen, and you have to agree with them.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-027228-027333 Exactly. Correct, that is, and if not, then, I extort you
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-027474-027670 It is exact.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-027755-028011 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-027941-028197 With embargo, with everything there might be, or the worst ways, with violence, with war
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-028307-028448 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-028453-028654 This
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-028714-028945 Delicate, but I believe and from what I have seen that the North American town is waking up in some way
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-029523-029859 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-029753-030025 And there are a bit more people that are realizing what is really happening, because they have them in a bubble
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-030768-031094 Still a lot is lacking, and that is what gives me more
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-030918-031019 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-031094-031330 Manipulating makes me mad
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-031692-031787 Clearly
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-031747-032078 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-032425-032625 Liberal or communist
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-032580-032686 Clearly
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-032625-032831 They give you these labels and
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-032731-032992 Some bad labels continue.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-032887-033178 If you are not a terrorist, leave.  We don't want you if you don't like
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-033389-033539 Correct
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-033494-033795 No this country, he the leaders of the country
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-033846-034001 Exactly, that is what they sometimes say to me, what are you doing here?
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-034147-034423 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-034242-034323 I could be in Venezuela and not support the president
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-034940-035337 Country or not, does not imply that you have a position
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-035297-035427 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-035337-035678 Nobody knows the reason for the people being here
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-035673-035779 Of course.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-035723-035899 In the opportune moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people, for example, in Venezuela they don't live in Venezuela and what they are doing is throwing them the enema

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-036913-037169 That you don't have to be here to support or not support.  When they tell me that, it makes me laugh.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-037852-037948 Yes.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-037867-038229 What do they do here? The same thing you are doing. Thank God you are here and not in Venezuela.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-038394-038696 No, but also in Spain it's the same, what happens is that different. The left government but even if it were right it is another mentality because the
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-039097-039374 When it is not agreed, it is thrown in the streets and they make manifestations and I have never seen it.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-039389-039655 Correct, no. Well with all the gasoline problems that have really been

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-040177-040323 In a surprising manner, that the people don't protest, I say, my God but what happens with these people? well
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-041201-041467 When it affects your wallet is when you react. I don't know what happens, they change their car and then buy a more economic car.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-042085-042336 Yes.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-042195-042391 I don't know what happens, but in general, they don't have the necessity to protest under certain things.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-042923-043109 Yes.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-043039-043270 All of a sudden here. You were in Pennsylvania you say?

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-043521-043651 In Philadelphia. Here I have felt there is a little more, that people are starting to wake up
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-044224-044495 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-044294-044515 I feel that they are rejecting the politics of the current president and like they are seeing that really things are not like they are painting them because
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-045323-045534 Me too.  In the beginning I did not have access to that page. My God, could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela? I will speak with my friends
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-046212-046629 They would tell me, no, what is that? Look at the power of television.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-046995-047076 Yes

20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-047874-048326 Philadelphia is a democrat city, everybody is democrat, but the rest of the state is republican and of people the anglo of the people that have things told to them
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-048898-049109 I don't know, very radical
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-049084-049235 Correct.

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-050987-051288 And do you think it's better there than Miami?
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-051007-051143 We are in the process.  The work is better here in the North.  The south is really saturated.

20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-051931-052237 And well, for certain things, easier.

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-054366-054532 I have been here six years, and we're about to come back, God permitting.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-054898-055215 Yes, where are you from?
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-055486-055767 Yeah, that is good, that is good, to move like that. You see, I live
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-055762-056033 The republicans came in with Bush and everything went to hell.

20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-056716-056871 The to my husband is american look at him and he tells me he has much resentment because he says look at your country
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-057419-057765 The world is destroyed.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-057554-057871 My God
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-057765-057986 They believe they are the owners of everything
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-058082-058302 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-058202-058478 There is the power of resentment.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-058302-058644 Yes. Notice that before I used to be a little like that. Today I understand that is like us because we do not have
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-058965-059216 Our government is at fault
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-059146-059342 Sure
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-059216-059502 I used to see the Americans like that. I understood that they were United States citizens because this is another concept they work.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-059944-060055 Yeah
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-060251-060522 We are also Americans
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-060492-060597 Sure
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-060522-060798 Then after that I start to reflect a little and no, they are not northamericans  it is the government politics what they do
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-061636-061973 They decide and it reflects against the town, against the country.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-062108-062204 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-062143-062274 That is the political state of goverment

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-062972-063112 Sure.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-063067-063459 I have to persist and I have to deal with the government does, but on the hand I don't know, I don't like it, it's a
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-063574-063720 You have the right to protest in a democracy.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-063926-064016 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-064222-064292 I hope that is it.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-064584-064664 It's like a dictatorship.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-064835-065020 It doesn't effect anyone,the project, this linguistic thing,  at least it's an fairly controversial issue, when I heard
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-065543-065648 Very
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-065668-065899 The issue, I was dying, so I said
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-065804-065969 I
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-065899-066090 Why?
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-065979-066180 I'm going to talk about Bush, because I have so much anger
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-066597-066817 Thanks to God, you're not alone. I listen to so many people that say it's not, they talk but they rant and rave about him and I say
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-067325-067451 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-067385-067712 The people have realized
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-067616-067762 That is what
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-067732-068023 They think that the people are so dumb that they're not going to realize.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-067817-068068 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-068023-068334 Realize the atrocities that they are doing
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-068249-068550 The whole throws their hands above their head and exclaims
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-068831-069092 By next week they forget about it
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-069012-069173 Sure
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-069092-069358 The press and TV move on to something else to distract and then people forget.
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-069479-069735 Sure, a short while ago, the Latin American film festival ended
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-070182-070277 None
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-070227-070493 They showed a movie, the Argentinian, but the directors were Spanish.

20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-070860-071276 And then, really interesting, because you know that the Spanish film industry has many types of movies, and this one was a protest movie, sort of...
20051107_184634_438_fsp-B-071387-071452 Yes
20051107_184634_438_fsp-A-071477-071779 Documentary

20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-000381-000617 Hello Mercedes, How are you? Where are you from Mercedes?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-000863-001081 From Honduras.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-001040-001192 Oh, Honduras?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-001128-001363 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-001192-001310 Wow, I have a sister in law from Honduras also.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-001733-001998 Where exactly?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-001909-002039 I know that she is Honduranean
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-002321-002562 That's nice.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-002497-002709 Yes, it is.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-002562-002785 Where are you from?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-002709-002920 I'm from Mexico.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-002785-003044 Where? The city, the capital?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-003255-003461 From the city. yes, Mexico City. Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-003766-004119 And what do you think about today's issue? That is it easier to break up with someone when you're young or, or if age makes a difference.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-004754-004959 I've already passed that stage and i'm married, but for example -The experience that I had was, was very difficult
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-006064-006199 It is difficult when you actually do not love her but believe it is everything else that you do love.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-007098-007251 To each their own.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-007169-007463 Yep.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-007251-007610 I believe that when you really love the person but in this case i imagine you did not get alone with the person
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-008256-008385 I really do not know. maybe the two people weren't getting along. I believe they should
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-009220-009361 Communication in a relationship
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-009567-009743 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-009608-009808 Or between in the relationship. And if one of the two pieces is missing, there will be distrust and
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-010566-010818 This can cause a break up and may be hurtful.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-011347-011864 Did you ever have a break up that was hard
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-011917-012047 Well really, yes because for example, before I married my husband I was going with a person and for example,
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-013616-014068 It was not a long time but my first boyfriend.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-014056-014150 Yes?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-014080-014285 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-014280-014462 Is hard always.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-014285-014714 It was the first illusion i had,with him i will get married
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-015520-015919 I will have three children and I was putting my castles in the air.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-016548-016807 How?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-016701-016871 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-016807-017136 I had more experiences to say, until now everything is finished, I believe for him
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-017723-018029 It was not very easy but for me yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-017929-018193 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-018029-018434 Everything was for the best, because then I met the one that is now my husband and, wow, he is a lot better!
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-019034-019192 The truth
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-019134-019257 How good
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-019216-019369 I don't know then
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-019257-019475 So, you have only had two boyfriends?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-019439-019762 That's right, and
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-019486-019657 Just looking for trouble.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-019762-019874 And you?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-020033-020250 When ther is no need
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-020197-020497 Yes, how did it happen to you?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-020479-020820 I don't think I ever had a difficult experience.

20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-021884-022266 The first boyfriend I was with for about two years
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-022483-022607 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-022583-023047 I remember we decided that then, I don't remember the exact reason, we would break up
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-023306-023471 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-023347-023682 But that was ten years ago
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-023676-023876 Wow
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-023682-024111 I was nineteen, eighteen; it was
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-023958-024188 Are you married now?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-024111-024282 Yes
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-024188-024276 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-024282-024499 We will let ourselves be seen afterwards.  It was not so difficult that we each lived apart and on our own.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-024699-024769 Aha.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-025228-025645 There was another boy I went out with for a few months where he didn't live with me.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-025657-025774 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-025927-026338 We were, in university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-026233-026350 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-026338-026920 That one was also easy because you stop seeing him quick. It's easy really.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-026809-027002 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-026920-027079 In that way.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-027026-027185 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-027079-027314 I didn't have any formal boyfriend. I never had a certain experience. Thank God.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-028524-028648 Yes. I think that, in my case, the first person that I fell in love too much
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-030005-030211 It was a lot
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-030170-030258 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-030211-030440 More than how much he loved me, I think. And it wasn't long, two or three months.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-031046-031145 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-031098-031292 But also I don't want to let it affect me.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-032003-032150 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-032045-032109 I think that he didn't think that way, I don't know if I was his third, fourth or fifth.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-032938-033414 He said yes and i am not going to marry her and i am goingto be with her and get to know here and that's it. I think i wa teh one that was getting my hopes up because of that
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-034043-034166 Truthfully, yes it still hurts
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-034313-034477 Really
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-034413-034613 Yes, it hurts because I think you are excited and have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no, well.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-035706-036111 But I think that it must, it must hurt a lot more when you already live together like in a marriage.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-036352-036499 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-036381-036558 I think the must be the worst experience of your life. I hope to never go through it because we never know.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-037422-037621 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-037492-037968 I hope I never go through that. I've been married for three years now and everything is working wonderfully.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-038280-038415 Thank God.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-038344-038703 A lot of communication
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-038462-039002 You also say that is nothing; everything can be perfect, is true always. Besides
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-038785-039008 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-039002-039473 Because there are people that are mistaken there's people that think that marriage is according to the stage and everything is peaceful
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-039761-039884 No.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-039791-039989 But and you live with the person day and night and you see it
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-040148-040284 Yes
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-040401-040666 Is impossible for it to remain? A situation like that there is,
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-040812-040995 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-041077-041382 Yes, you always love the person but it's impossible for there to always be only peace, well that's what I'm saying, right?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-041641-041747 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-041665-041888 I am one to be human and things bother other people a lot, correct?
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-042452-042575 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-042528-042816 To any other people.  I am not saying to that person particularly, but to any other person.  I know that
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-043192-043651 Twenty-four hours a day, it is a coin of whole world.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-043968-044092 So it is.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-044021-044168 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-044162-044573 Yes, the truth is it's very difficult to keep everything happy.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-045208-045408 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-045302-045590 And I think that also that and I think that when you take your engagement, for example you can know and, accordingly, you go knowing the person
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-046348-046607 Ou're not going to know thoroughly, right? until now you are married with that person
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-047670-047994 If you see that you don't get along with that person, I have known people that they beat up their boyfriends, and they abused and and they required them to everything that they wanted then
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-049151-049398 I think that nothing good is going to come from those relationships because if they still aren't married
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-049692-050039 And to behave
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-049768-049927 Imagine how it's going to be if they're married
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-050303-050456 Yes, yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-050626-050903 Now like they treat her, then I think that those relationships, they're not going to work ever, I don't know. Or change him or
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-051831-052001 If it was a relationship like that, it doesn't have to hurt anything.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-052701-053053 You have to think it over if you have a boyfriend that beats you
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-052901-053147 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-053053-053412 You're going to rest, you're going to say, it's good we finished. everything starts doing it well
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-054146-054423 Everything is going well and suddenly someone must travel to another country or has to go to another school, I think that that would hurt
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-055257-055439 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-055416-056003 Because, everything is fine, but only the third circumstances, well, they have to separate. So, I think that this type of relationships, well that really hurts, but if it's a relationship that
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-056591-056967 That they hit you no
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-056773-056944 No, yes, that. It's ironic that those are the most difficult relationships at times.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-057843-058295 For people that are involved in that type of relationship
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-058260-058348 That's true.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-058295-058460 Because usually people, when they are in that type of situation, there is a very low self confidence
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-059171-059306 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-059218-059529 And then they think that, people think that that's what, that's what's better that some times it's going to eh, what I'll be able to achieve
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-060076-060376 I have to keep on enduring
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-060540-060775 Yes.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-060546-060963 Really it's not as easy as one thinks to. He did that to me, I'm going to send him packing. No.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-061322-061492 That's true.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-061404-061633 It's hard, rather, because, let's not say an addict, but yes to that type of situation that
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-062368-062838 The drama is people don't know how to get out of that cycle of abuse. That's what happens.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-063555-063919 Yes, it's true, you're right
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-063608-063855 Yes, but
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-063919-064095 One time I was in Mexico, I met a girl one time with dark glasses.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-064877-064989 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-064942-065388 I asked Do you wear glasses now? It was a cloudy day.  She had a bruise that her boyfriend had given her.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-065817-066076 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-065917-066193 And told her you must not allow your boyfriend to touch you
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-066734-066875 Because..., and she said, well it is very difficult to end my relationship with him. And I told her Why? And she said
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-067651-067868 I still love him
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-067798-067956 Mhn.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-067892-068150 And then, I told her What? How can you love a person who beats you? Sometimes she used to come bruised, and sometimes he..
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-068861-069014 None
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-069008-069220 Used to smack her and similar things.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-A-069196-069320 No
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-069238-069414 Therefore as sometimes you say those type of relationships are the hardest. And finally when she managed to do it I remember that she used to cry.
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-070507-070830 Every time that she could, at every break and similar occasions, because she missed him and all that. Therefore I think, somehow sometimes,
20051109_180253_445_fsp-B-071523-071747 Some relationships, I imagine that it was very painful for her
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-000025-000096 Carolina
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-000156-000298 Fabiola
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-000353-000540 What's up, Fabiola?, How are you?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-000535-000712 Fine, and you?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-000657-000894 What do you think about today's subject?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-000950-001197 In Washingtion, yeah.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-001071-001299 Dear mother, very far away.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-001531-001632 And you?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-001617-001769 I'm in Los Angeles.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-001779-001935 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-001900-002102 Yeah
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-002021-002158 Extremes
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-002138-002401 We're just on the on opposite sides. That's good; and, where are you from?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-002734-002810 Chilean
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-002866-002951 Where?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-002992-003209 Chilean from Chile.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-003154-003492 Chilean. I'm from Venezuela.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-003548-003705 From Maracabio?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-003664-004003 No I'm not. Why, do you know people from there?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-003983-004251 Yes, I'm right here
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-004205-004796 Yeah. Well, you know that they have a stronger accent. Right?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-004786-004898 Yes.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-004842-005186 Yeah,
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-004928-005085 Look, and are you Arepa?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-005231-005408 Yes, yes, yes. And that's great. Because sometimes it's very difficult to find Venezuelans, and they say no. No, in fact we know very few Venezuelans.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-006480-006692 We are very few here, in fact. But in about ten years, it has increased.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-007592-007668 Yes.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-007637-007743 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-007693-007759 Young woman from Venezuela, in Houston.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-008299-008476 Do you work at the Hilton?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-008759-009012 No. In Houston
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-008967-009533 I heard in Hilton
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-009017-009078 Texas. No Texas
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-010099-010367 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-010357-010463 Do you work?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-010458-010670 I work with deaf children.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-010731-010842 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-010807-010958 Yeah, when I got here, Bill Clinton was there, the country was in an incredible period. A lot of work, everybody happy, the economy going up
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-011509-011681 A great job
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-011666-011878 Listen, yes. Very strong work.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-011888-012272 Yes, but it satisfies you to have it
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-012136-012192 Yes
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-012293-012470 Having power to help people
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-012465-012702 Exactly. I was doing the same in Venezuela, only that I was using sign language.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-013440-013678 I learned the alphabet there
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-013673-014016 Ok, Chilean of course, no?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-013860-013956 I learned, yes
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-014163-014219 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-014239-014365 But, with signs
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-014360-014491 Correct, But Here it is oral
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-014840-015305 My daughter taught me the alphabet, some words
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-015300-015376 Okay
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-015305-015481 Not all, some like I love you
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-015624-015695 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-015689-015831 Yes, small words.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-015791-015962 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-015978-016038 Pretty
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-016109-016286 Yes, I'm with the first oral part? I'm at the other end
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-017186-017696 Here the children are given incentives to talk .
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-017757-017914 How ? To talk ?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-017878-017959 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-017944-018141 Without listening, but, talk,
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-018111-018303 Yes. Because they with auxiliary earpieces, are able to listen in.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-018748-018844 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-018753-019299 Then they train you orally so they can recognize the sounds.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-019299-019430 How beautiful.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-019385-019551 They have the possiblility to speak clearly and you will feel the difference as she speak
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-020729-020992 They will have that option. There are some parents who combine sign language with the oral part. No? Depends on
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-021887-022824 Depending on the grade of auditory loss of the child. If it is very profound, there are no possibilities, even with the best operation, there
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-023039-023373 We utilize sign language as complement.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-023423-023696 What a hard job for parents.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-023605-024030 It is great work, truthfully.  It is very, very hard.  But it is very rewarding.  In the end you have your reward.  Of course, you have to, as we say 'put on the batteries'.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-025582-026042 Because, in another form, well, hardly, they are going to achieve it, well.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-026062-026461 What is your opinion on the topic that they gave to us today?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-026411-026810 I think  that the relationships between partners are not at all simple. You have to fight with a person that
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-027861-028387 That is different from you. That comes from another world, customer, another way of being. Then attempt to have a single project.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-028817-029211 Sometimes it is a bit difficult. No? But, I think that love is the only thing that makes it possible for barriers to be overcome
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-029777-030267 Only if there's love and a lot of disposition from the partners so that those tiffs that can be had at any moment,
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-031203-031339 They overcome themselves. Do you think so?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-031395-031450 I think suddenly more of love.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-031951-032021 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-032112-032325 It is acquired with time.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-032254-032330 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-032355-033135 I believe tht you want to maintain your family and to keep them because there are very few people who love
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-032547-032643 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-033159-033310 Twelve,  imagine. We have had two critical moments to the point of nearly separating. There was a point where maturity plays an important role, no?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-033861-033937 Correct.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-033917-034235 They don't work hard. And they love each other maybe even more than a couple who has been married for 30 years.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-034599-034690 Of course.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-034700-034898 They struggle day to day and they overcome problems, they go above problems.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-035216-035302 Correct.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-035297-035787 They as so young that the first thing that occurs to them when they have the opportunity, fight, split up
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-035337-035403 Yes.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-035787-035909 If they decided to stay with or marry that partner,
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-036272-036358 Of course.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-036313-036353 It is forever already. Do not go running after the first problem.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-036737-036828 With my husband we are going to reach eight years of marriage
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-037379-037470 It went well, I was ready, I was ripe for the picking as we say here.  I said, stop, I've got this far
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-037400-037450 Yes, they gave him another one. It didn't work well on him and then they had to stop using it and return to basics.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-038860-039027 Yes.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-038951-039229 In another moment in my life I'd have done it.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-039235-039356 Me too.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-039320-039513 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-039391-039674 But I had done nothing important.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-039578-040048 I had done nothing important. I don't see a thing.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-039937-040347 Yes, I said stop me if I fall. What is the problem?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-040205-040362 Exactly.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-040352-040539 But now I think three things.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-040518-040594 I understand.  Right now it is true what you say.  But he has other things.  I'm focused on the good things he has.  I say that he is different from me.  He can't think like I can and it doesn't bother me if he doesn't.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-041787-041903 But he gave me his
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-042217-042414 I understand. I feel the same as well.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-042232-042293 No? I understood exactly. But, unfortunately, good, the first was horrible because I thought that it was the end of the world. And good, I felt, and waited a long time that one day we tried while I thought it was a good day but is that what's happening?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-043930-044481 We have, we were married three weeks. we had almost gone three weeks. Never in life had we lasted three weeks without seeing each other without hablarnose. And sleeping in the same bed
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-044719-044876 Oh my god
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-044734-045083 Horrible. I said look, do you understand this?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-045139-045320 I haven't touched it. It hasn't come to that.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-045290-045689 It's not that bad. It's very rude on our part, in reality. He said, you know what? I think that this is full of crap.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-046139-046407 It does not have to make sense, if you do not want to continue with the project, we won't continue.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-047024-047110 I love you. But this can't continue, because you go for a day and I go for the other. And the truth, I think that I love you. And that's why I love you.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-047964-048490 Is this what I need to define it this way? It's insensitive on our part to live this way. In this way I don't believe in God.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-048889-049036 We will working on it. Because, irrespective of how serious may be the situation, that luckily wasn't so serious but that neither side wanted give in. right?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-049981-050087 It was pride
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-050062-050310 Fool pride.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-050244-050436 Yes, it's up to nothing
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-050375-050618 To nothing. But the opposite
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-050471-050775 Only affect
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-050709-050850 We are back on track. I think the first one was the one which really left us marked
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-051932-051973 It's a channel of the state but, now the state
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-052625-052933 Ripe for the picking, ready to throw in the towel
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-052802-053737 Yes, I was ready to give in and said that I would not allow you to do it because you are wrong.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-053757-054328 If something I learned from this life, is to search for solutions to problems than can be solved
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-054374-054449 Sure
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-054424-054864 What are we going to do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. There are people who spend thirty years together and that's a crap of a relationship.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-055536-055592 Yes?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-055556-056158 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-056032-056133 A girl, and sometimes they treat each other well, but they don't love each other
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-056411-056603 Exactly
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-056502-056734 They spend all their lives together.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-056729-057502 Yes. A thousand things happen. Couples go through so much, that is an interesting topic. Because, you say,
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-057568-058225 There are people whom look a lot like each other, but do not love each other.  I got accostumed to live with him
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-058084-058342 They respect
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-058291-058387 Exactly.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-058377-058665 And, what they wanted to form was a family, and so.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-058655-059282 There are others that definitely they do whatever they feel like and they keep up an image.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-059160-059403 If there's no love, there's nothing.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-059580-060399 It's true that there has to be a big love. I feel that in my relationship, what was possible was love.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-060434-060566 Because truthfully, with a situation that was so difficult, like we were living, if there hadn't have been love, we would have broken up. Because it just wouldn't have made any sense.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-061501-061708 It doesn't make any sense to continue something  like that, where there's no love.  Yes, I feel that a lot of love. Many of his promises that you were talking about
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-062572-062881 To be here because you want to be, because it was worth it.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-062780-063063 Nobody is forcing you. You want to be here, and you fight.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-063361-063568 Exactly.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-063482-063750 You could have a couple. And when you have it, you have
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-063755-063877 Exactly.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-063947-064215 The hardest is to keep it going
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-064185-064665 That's the hardest. Yes, sir. And to seek how to be constantly in that harmony that, like new things, we're going to do differently, let's not slip into a routine.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-065747-065807 None
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-065757-066257 But, no. It's that as time goes by, you know, but, the important things is that you can not leave her.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-066207-066515 For sure I recognize that Exactly
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-066389-066606 And that the system will also bring you to that conclusion.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-066616-066697 Your husband is also Chilean?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-066904-067026 He is from here
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-067005-067172 Love can do anything
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-067774-067946 So easy
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-067910-068102 You think it is easier?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-068067-068401 From the American music there is a mister that we call
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-068365-068835 Oh, okay, becasue my husband is Venezuelan and,
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-068633-068739 For certain
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-068876-069598 I believe it has nothing to do with nationality. It is a universal thing.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-069609-069912 Yes, I believe that for me it is easier because sometimes, they are very entertaining because I don't understand everything he says or he says it fast. Then it doesn't go well. No, fighting had no point.
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-071009-071211 A lot with him, because it makes me laugh
20051109_210353_450_fsp-B-071358-071474 And, what was that you said?
20051109_210353_450_fsp-A-071605-071863 What do you say?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-000035-000111 Bad.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-000040-000116 Hello.

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-001481-001627 Good, and you?

20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-001956-002107 Of Chile.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-002133-002304 Me too?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-002299-002390 Really?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-002385-002471 Yes.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-002446-002658 Oh, that's good.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-002582-002805 That's funny
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-002906-003128 How long did you live there?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-002926-003042 Yes. Well more or less for example I'm there all two thousand three
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-003604-003730 Oh, okay.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-003765-003998 And what you call it, then I would come and go but more or less in ninety one, yes. You?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-004579-004872 I've been living here since two thousand two.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-004887-005110 It is not that long for nothing.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-005044-005231 It's been a short time
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-005241-005479 From Santiago probably
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-005418-005545 Yes, from Santiago.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-005545-005661 Of course.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-005651-005858 Where are you from?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-005833-005959 I lived.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-005898-006000 From Santiago also?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-005979-006374 I lived there in Santiago and in Concepcion.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-006379-006490 Oh, okay.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-006495-006702 Sure,
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-006919-007016 Look, what a small world.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-007152-007374 Yes, that sounds good.

20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-012914-013031 Yes
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-013172-013334 Fun, they give you a subject to
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-013587-013824 To talk about something what I thought.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-013602-013683 It must be
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-013991-014087 Yes, I think so.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-014016-014112 I thought I would make a phone menu and items similar to that in this study.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-014881-014962 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-014911-015128 For hospitals, theaters and stuff, people wanted to talk about health and stuff. For example
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-015801-016074 It was because you have to talk about personal things.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-016579-016973 You should not or do not want to do
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-016938-017095 Because you shouldn't like personal things
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-017383-017489 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-017398-017484 You never know if another person is on the phone.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-017752-018010 Of course, OK
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-017909-018000 So, that's why they give you subjects to have to talk about
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-018308-018743 I thought in this part of the study Castilian and Spanish were required. Maybe I am wrong.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-019117-019228 Okay.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-019213-019400 No
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-019258-019566 All they told me was that I had to talk about issues of importance.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-020178-020310 Of course
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-020213-020542 Have a theme, don't talk as a pure head of sin
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-020355-020461 Is the fruit
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-020886-021042 If what

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-021831-022084 Yes, I was in Washington near Seattle when I came to the United States.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-022200-022281 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-022448-022796 I'm in Atlanta Georgia so it's as good here as it is for everyone there
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-023858-024187 Even more to be posted there
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-024111-024222 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-024252-024323 Idaho is really rural whereas here it is not.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-024712-024874 It's like the countryside
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-025172-025582 Yes, I would imagine myself there, why not, it depends
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-025491-025738 Yes, it's like how there isn't much nightlife there
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-026224-026380 I bet. The thing is, being in Atlanta, it's a pretty big city. Supposedly life should be really great here, you see.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-027133-027326 In two or three years
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-027295-027391 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-027326-027417 Also the stores, bars, and clubs need to close at 2 a.m.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-028079-028230 At 2.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-028210-028478 At 2 in the morning, everything is closed.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-028458-028640 And why
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-028645-028877 So the reason is that it has the sector like that in Atlanta it is called Bucks Head
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-029489-029565 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-029529-029787 Two or threes years ago, there was crime that led to three people were killed. They killed three persons.

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-031627-031733 Yes, a city that has to have an obligation.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-032476-032739 Yes. but over there do people use any cars or is there more public?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-033229-033548 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-033411-033634 To go out at two am is not

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-034149-034311 I would prefe to have a system so good
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-035231-035418 Expensive and on top of that

20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-037930-038032 It doesn't take too long to travel in the city I live in. Santiago is half of the port, so there are much less people.

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-046256-046387 Yes, like from middle east, they tell me

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-046620-046802 They try to talk to my in Arabic. They think I have more of an Indian face or something, but is that discrimination or not?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-047545-047631 Yes, the same, but not the same
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-047767-047893 None

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-051229-051659 So, it is the fact that it is more diverse that it is much more acceptable. I don't know, but at the same time to the south is the south of the
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-052210-052331 United States has that history of being one of the more racist places of the whole United States, in fact here

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-054490-054586 Yes, but.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-054505-054834 No, it's not something massive, it's not semi-heavy
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-055374-055789 Of course for example in the rural parts of Georgia they saw things like were seen in the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-056067-056178 Yes, really.

20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-062138-062633 Something like, We live together.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-062598-062719 Okay
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-062694-062891 Clearly
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-062744-062805 What do you call it? Do you like it or not?
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-063447-063705 Yes, because or its like I am in the city, I like it more city because of, I am from the city or the countryl. For example I lived in San Rafael I don't know if you're familiar but
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-064594-064847 He walked from San Felipe to the Andes which is in the question more rural and you couldn't imagine how
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-065373-065459 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-065418-065671 Typical Chilean country and that enchanted me.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-065656-065727 Yes
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-065676-066090 Like to be in the city because it is it is more hip
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-066449-067005 I don't know
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-066925-067046 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-067010-067127 Then
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-067182-067314 Esta bien
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-067288-067400 Yes
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-067415-067546 It's not like
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-067430-067506 But
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-067551-067748 It's a super drastic change for me to come here
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-067961-068148 I imagine
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-068128-068593 I was accustomed to live in the city  I could find all I need but the life is more
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-069017-069093 Is more calm
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-069285-069401 Sure
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-069326-069548 More calm and everything, there is not as much crime as in a big city
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-070326-070433 Sure
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-070382-070650 But is bored.
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-070549-070776 Yes, I imagine
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-070650-070933 Kind of
20051111_181045_470_fsp-A-070862-071150 None
20051111_181045_470_fsp-B-071135-071267 It's the same.  Like at least Chico is not that Big
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-000000-000505 Well. Oh. Hello, Juan. Marcela
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-000096-000300 Hello. How are you? My name is Juan. Marcela.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-000515-000667 Yes.  How is it going?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-000596-000773 Didn't we talk the other day?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-000677-001152 I think so. You are in Texas and I am in North Carolina.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-000930-000985 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-001213-001344 Yes, with pleasure.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-001278-001531 I have not forgotten you. Did we practice together, no? yes. Listen, but I am tocan, health.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-001870-002011 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-002016-002269 DO YOU HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY OR COVERED
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-002213-002517 I am covered through my husband
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-002522-002608 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-002618-003002 The children are covered so we are alright.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-002689-002850 We are not.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-003012-003224 It is a problem, no?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-003093-003235 We are not covered. It is a problem because something can always happen
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-003659-004144 We are very healthy but you never know.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-003765-003871 The other day I went to an office which supposedly they gave you a pension.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-005246-005464 People like that in the community, no?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-005428-005550 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-005560-005661 They already have the papers that they asked for with my address and proof of work. They finally found an excuse to not give it to me because they asked
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-006965-007187 Me to give information about the person who was hiring me and in that moment because the person didn't want to give out the information
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-007713-007824 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-007809-007890 And, in my case I have a son who has epilepsy
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-008229-008401 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-008365-008643 They need people nowadays that have patience.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-008815-009068 They didn't give you the attention?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-009113-009229 He was sick and got worse.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-010271-010569 Then i had to go back to mexico. there he got attention from a doctor
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-010837-010948 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-010973-011221 They perscribed him medicine and already i've run out of it once. Normally I buy it in Mexico.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-011767-012010 Yes, but it can be cheaper.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-011914-012313 It is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me medical samples
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-012808-013273 Yes, that helps. what a thing.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-012874-012919 Yes, we think if there is a community it should be a certain kind
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-014689-015346 I think that the whole system is going to have to fall
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-015861-016367 The costs of everything, depend on demand. And then if these costs are rising and rising
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-016417-016503 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-016872-017226 Because there is more demand and because people pay it. And then they raise the costs because people ask more and more money and people who work ask for more money, it is a vicious circle. And then how can suddenly they can have socialized medicine?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-018015-018101 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-018459-018925 It is impossible because all of that. People already are like
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-018459-018631 Yes it should be
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-018935-019460 Money does not stop being like a drug, you see. They are already used to a certain amount of money.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-019460-019592 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-019470-019733 And then suddenly they are not going to have it.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-019723-019829 It is a problem, it is a circle that works with the earnings
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-020037-020117 Yes. Of course it is.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-020279-020486 Then the interest is worse
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-020310-020673 We would stop making bombs and going to war
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-020694-020775 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-020906-021381 For school or a medical system, of social medicine
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-020906-021002 Well, if they would lower it just a little bit.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-021391-021604 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-021543-021786 With that.  Over here I don't know where you are living.  Here, if somebody has money it is the nurses and the doctors.  Isn't it?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-022898-023322 Nurses are paid very well because few nurses you know there are less
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-023019-023090 Then. And Well so here that as they say, time a good care with a woman that is around thirty years old, for example, no?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-024141-024293 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-024303-024556 When you find out if they really are nurses
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-024818-025364 Yes. Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-024960-025081 Yes, to me. Then here in this case it does get offered. In Canada it is my understanding they have much medicine, isn't it?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-026203-026335 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-026335-026552 Then any Canadian resident has rights to medical services, just to be there and they don't have any economical consequences
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-027386-027841 No, but the difference is that they started right.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-027492-027578 Yes, exactly.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-027952-028225 It's Argentina, my parents paid all the medical bills.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-028498-028574 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-028508-029115 All medical coverage is paid, they only pay a small amount
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-028761-028827 Yes, this is one thing we should make.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-029600-029742 Yes
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-029651-029903 Having some type of social security, but even that is really
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-029924-030308 Yes, it's really expensive
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-029974-030065 It's expensive right?, I don't know how drugs are, but in Mexico is cheaper
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-030753-031238 All over the world.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-031152-031592 And there is more competition there in drugs. That's weird.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-031369-032310 Yes, there was a drug my son was taking there, and when we moved here we couldn't find it.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-032330-032411 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-032390-033027 So, we went to Argentina last year, I went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-033331-033664 I bought it there for 12 dollars
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-033356-033427 Yes
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-033664-033988 $12.00, the same company and everything
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-033877-033942 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-033988-034827 It could have been less if I bought the unknown brand.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-034048-034134 Same. yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-034857-035292 I don't understand.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-034953-035064 There are five or six brands of my son's medicine in Mexico.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-035696-035868 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-035828-036000 With similar ingredients
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-035979-036171 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-036000-036065 No? Yes, here there's only one. nd second that in the literature is not the best. And listen but only the laboratories, I thought that all the American laboratories
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-037440-037748 So at the time of competition well here there's a monopoly.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-037789-037971 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-037819-037885 Big interest in everything, no?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-038102-038446 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-038315-038385 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-038456-038840 According to things like this
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-038527-038628 But
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-038850-039528 According to the specialty they have to operate here. You know what you have to do?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-038962-039037 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-039609-040215 Why don't you contact an organization that is called the Shriners?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-040291-040458 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-040427-040640 Shriners yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-040518-040690 Yes, I already know.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-040700-041014 They help the children.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-041024-041095 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-041034-041459 I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease or if they cover everything.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-041701-041767 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-041863-042793 You can communicate with them and say, he hears we have this boy, and this is his condition, and this is our situation.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-042823-042914 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-042884-043177 And perhaps they can help in some way. Because the Shriners are dedicated to helping, to paying for the medical care of children. That they can't pay.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-043956-044021 Then yes he sees
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-044138-044320 Of the parents who can't pay.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-044350-044471 Yes he knew of that.  Was it already time?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-044633-045260 What I know, they say that it is twelve minutes but the twelve minutes seems like half an hour.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-045240-045305 I noticed that. Yes I only knew and thought it was for me. And I much smaller without you tiring and for more style
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-045988-046513 Yes, Perhaps, uncertain to find out it costs nothing.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-046458-046599 I am going to crash
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-046594-047171 If you call Catholic Charities
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-047090-047160 Yes.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-047211-047484 Perhaps they have what I know, a wave or something you see that it can help you in
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-047853-048181 Yes it's simple, because on one hand the maintenance is a medicine that this person who helped me with the sample says no man this
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-048768-048940 Just go to some community center
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-049233-049395 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-049334-049435 Knowing a bit more, I can give a deeper diagnosis and give medicine that could improve the life of my son.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-050663-050820 With the epilepsy
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-050719-050901 Sure.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-050860-051224 It was under control, but lately, nearly two years it has been uncontrolled.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-051487-051588 And of course he's growing up and then maybe that medicine doesn't work anymore.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-051684-051791 What are you going to do about it?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-053135-053246 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-053322-053519 Yes, I was very ill.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-053519-053651 What a thing.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-053605-053939 It's a matter of experimenting.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-053812-054227 You must live with your hearts in your mouth.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-054323-054480 Sometimes yes
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-054379-054611 And that causes a lot of stress.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-054550-054717 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-054682-054834 Much stress

20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-057745-057937 How old is he?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-057952-058043 17

20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-058887-059454 Where you can ask? At teaching hospitals
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-058958-059019 System of

20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-059615-059691 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-059969-060323 Plenty of times at different apartments
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-060005-060080 Yes
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-060323-060485 They check people who can't afford a normal consultation. They take care of people like us who can't afford an specialized doctor
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-061056-061127 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-061465-061556 And we do not have
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-061572-061723 I see
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-061587-062234 They take note of whatever they give us,after that they charge
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-062719-063012 A reasonable account. Something we can afford
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-063472-063538 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-063508-064407 I had to get an abscess checked. It turns out I have something called ADD.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-064620-064700 Yeah
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-064670-064923 A few years ago, I thought I had it, but I had self-diagnosed. In the end, I found the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina here
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-065924-065979 Yeah
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-065974-066348 They performed all the test on me, and didn't charge me anything.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-066318-066419 Really?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-066358-066470 Yes
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-066475-066803 I went to precisely is called University system, healthcare system and something like that
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-067784-068057 Then it's that with the
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-068092-068431 It's precisely there where they bounced me
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-068107-068249 With the University?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-068471-068552 I told him
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-068593-068977 But what a thing
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-068618-068679 Then they told me, No, you have to give us information. I had a letter with my earnings and so on?
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-069422-069583 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-069674-069962 Not that, we needed was the social security of your employer. But that's when they didn't want to anymore
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-070271-070524 They didn't want to give you that information.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-070296-070645 No, but not me. Well, now I have my social security.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-071120-071363 Maybe now you can
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-071267-071337 Yes, employed
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-071433-071605 None
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-071534-071661 Well, maybe I'll go.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-A-071696-071868 Maybe, now you can.
20051111_182216_472_fsp-B-071873-071939 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-000046-000349 Hello how are you? my name is John
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-000077-000200 Matt here
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-000396-000900 I am in San Antonio and Matt, you are in Philadelphia and we have spoken before.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-000658-000777 Yes and you are
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-000998-001291 It's a pleasure to talk with you again
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-001271-001564 Yes, how have you been?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-001327-001641 Hey, everything is fine what do you think about today theme?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-001939-002202 I didn't listen. What's the theme?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-002202-002608 The theme is how dependent are you on technology?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-003349-003648 Consider the technology question no? in your daily life, if it become more in a problem than in a solution
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-004162-004584 This include cars?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-004435-004816 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-005073-005331 It is a machine.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-005356-005747 Yes if the cars seems to be so important no then i thought better is a computer
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-006164-006674 The most obvious its the computer
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-006674-006885 Seems like a personal element depending on the case. It can be a car because the computer is a tool every time.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-008017-008356 More than once, we said that belongs to the institution, where are you now? It is more than a work tool.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-008686-008773 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-008865-009187 But that tool is very personal seems like a car no?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-009216-009432 Yes, any car you buy will become a large part of your life. You will want to use it often and, therefore, must keep it well maintained..
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-010080-010368 Do you need to look after the car, do you know?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-010415-010507 Yes, exactly, besides as I'm here in Texas
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-011068-011233 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-011073-011614 I feel that the automobile culture here is reminiscent of the horse culture too.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-011686-011897 Did you use the horses more?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-011696-011789 No ? it is like a horse, it is something like, very personal, very close
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-012210-012622 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-012488-012879 It's very important here that we take care of them over the course of their life.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-013312-013471 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-013358-013476 If they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age, like computers
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-014675-015061 As permitted by the information management
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-014686-014891 Yes, because, here in Texas yes, because up here in Texas
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-015154-015313 But
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-015421-015740 Do you need the car for work?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-015777-015859 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-015910-016008 Then
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-015915-016029 Here the working people are like mules. They need a pickup truck.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-017140-017459 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-017186-017377 Pick up truck, no ? give and do not leave, if you notice like there's a work culture that's very, very important
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-018267-018447 I see
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-018324-018905 In all houses there are television, telephone and computers. There are other dimensions. Of the technological question, the car seems to be
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-019739-019950 The most important
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-020001-020408 Which questions on the subject.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-020469-020825 What technology is most important in your life? Would it be the car or would it be the computer?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-021740-022291 Well, for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-022281-022584 Exactly
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-022512-022595 Because? because I have my cellular and I'm always with it
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-023058-023186 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-023114-023279 This is what happens to her when she is criticized. I then say to her that God loves you like you are, but you cannot be so critical towards others.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-023747-023835 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-023819-024164 Before, I didn't have a cellphone until I was twenty years old, but now that I live in Philadelphia and I'm not always at home for
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-024653-024885 I'm not always going back home for, you know? to look at my messages
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-025106-025301 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-025229-025384 I have my cellphone
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-025687-025857 You have your cellphone?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-025723-025991 I think that it's very surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone here in the United States.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-026516-026732 Notice that it's very important what youve just said.  a while ago when I worked I had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-027730-027792 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-027735-028193 There were message in the computer because it was always on the internet. Mail more than the telephone, neither the cellphone or anything else.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-028373-028440 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-028584-028770 The computer was the most important.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-028615-028739 But now,
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-028775-029331 The type of work that is the most important is auto work becuase it is real work, not like computer work.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-029886-030030 More physical, no? The the auto is converted in the apparatus and the computer, for a second diagram, is also very important.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-031276-031543 But of course if by the type of good work.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-031806-032114 Well, for me I think, very well, yourself was working for Texas and obviously you know. I understand that there is more like lands and someplace there. Understand?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-033221-033329 Way more space
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-033262-033427 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-033370-033638 For in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-033890-034152 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-034024-034250 Because you always have to try to park and pay for a lot for it, and the gas station is far away.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-035089-035248 It is more than a problem of one torque.  That one helps obviously.  Understand?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-035696-035794 Yes?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-036000-036262 It is better to have an auto.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-036288-036365 Yes, for the distance, the auto is fundamental.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-037157-037337 Clear
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-037193-037327 Depends in the job also, maybe it can be a computer
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-038013-038413 The next question or the apparatus of communication.no?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-038480-038557 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-038680-039118 And if you consider that those technologies will convert more into a problem
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-039622-039910 Well, what type of problems would it have, no?, like you just said, with the car, the problems that have to do with parking
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-040415-040543 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-040502-041135 No? Here in Texas there are no major problems with parking, there is a lot of space everywhere
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-041732-042025 The care issues with cars has not been a large problem.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-043873-044469 We could consider, as a problem, the interests created around the auto industry, and sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-044912-045241 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-045056-045581 But don't you think it's great that has changed in 60 years?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-045941-046039 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-045967-046307 We look how seventy-five years in the past there were no cars, but these days almost everybody has
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-046456-046543 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-046873-047135 And the same thing with the computers they have, they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until, like ten years, because
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-048097-048169 Since
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-048174-048504 Because they have the things very advances and the things have not
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-048530-048663 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-048833-049394 Gotten paid for their development costs, understand? I don't know how to explain it very well but
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-049132-049260 The auto industry would have advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-050830-051185 One hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-051185-051267 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-051288-051560 No? And instead of costing, say, twenty thousand dollars, it would cost you two thousand dollars
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-051967-052060 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-052008-052168 If that was the case, no? but, like technology, in this case industry, it has its own interests, it, like, moves on, you know what they're talking now about hybrids
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-053161-053619 They are not affordable, that it's really a matter of image that companies do, and when it comes to see the, the return tables
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-054324-054514 Of the hybrid cars, I thought they would be a lot more efficient, but I think what they've achieved is a minimal efficiency
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-055430-055507 Yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-055564-055878 No? no, I don't think that they are a really big technological breakthrough, given the efficiency that
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-056578-056835 Yes, that was a very important breakthrough
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-056933-056994 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-057036-057313 You don't think it's an important breakthrough
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-057293-058111 The efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-058281-058332 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-058502-058893 An economical car will give you thirty-six miles per gallon.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-059361-059444 Yeah
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-059439-059732 A Hybrid can give you fifty
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-059778-060319 Yes, there are cars now like Fords
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-059845-060061 Well
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-060329-060792 The pick up trucks no because they are changing them to be more efficient
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-060797-060910 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-060838-061260 But what else, and now, ant time here, surely you don't like it, right.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-061934-062017 Yes exactly, but at the same time for example with those autos, there have been small cars that give you almost the same mileage than the hybrid, and they are not hybrid, are they?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-063756-063967 By, small cars, new that are not in the Northamerican market, that are in the European or Latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-064384-064765 Oh, yes
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-064703-064883 Smaller, no? If we compare the costs of a hybrid against a smaller European car, or of the ones that circulate in Latin America, then
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-065958-066154 No- it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost and while it will save a lot in gas, it ends up
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-067039-067523 Being less than to what a car has, a good economy car, no?
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-067554-067749 And, why is it that
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-067631-067723 European
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-067780-068228 Why is it that the United States is one of the few nations, only here you have those huge cares
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-068578-068845 Yes, it is
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-068747-069149 Over there in other countries everybody has small cars , different culture
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-069607-069699 Yes years ago when there was the problem with petroleum, in the eighties
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-070343-070471 None
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-070502-071001 I thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture, because they started to develop smaller cars here in the United States.
20051112_181649_485_fsp-B-071012-071228 Yes, but
20051112_181649_485_fsp-A-071104-071531 I thought well as it was going to get change in their culture, but that was not only the moment. It seems there were some huge cars to which they continued to like.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-000000-000112 I'm Ana Maria.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-000096-000310 Faviola, hi
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-000203-000487 Hello Faviola
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-000396-000600 How are you?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-000514-000830 Fine and you? How's the weather there where you're at?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-000782-001082 Great, it's sunny but cold.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-001071-001268 Sunny, cold.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-001210-001296 Cold
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-001268-001724 It's bad here, it's really cold her. What do you think about movies? Have you already talked about that subject?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-001907-001976 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-001960-002228 I've talked about that before, too.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-002169-002458 The one I specifically remember talking about was about violence.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-002796-003160 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-002983-003391 They didn't like the idea of going to see movies. And I told them, that the world has violence
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-003851-003996 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-003958-004451 I've had the chance to teach children about peace and love with the TV or, or in the world and later when they go out into the real world at school.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-005357-005458 They find that kids hit each other, they don't know how to defend themselves. Especially when you have only children.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-006101-006251 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-006225-006380 It's ok that they rate the movies how they do. It's the responsibility of adults, even where their kids can watch tv.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-007419-007816 I agree. That's the most important responsibility of parents.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-007810-008175 They are doing their job
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-008199-008489 They are earning their money, what is your job.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-008292-008550 It is His business
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-008489-008674 Doing his business, yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-008651-008764 Yes today the one that wants, the one that wants to see, he doesn't want to see him anymore it is not their responsibility, they see
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-009270-009451 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-009375-009471 That they sell
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-009492-009691 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-009498-009975 It's what they do, it's no one's fault
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-009830-010264 Yes, of who likes the product, because of that
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-010216-010355 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-010275-010794 With you it is the maximum responsibility, if it is violence, sex, whatever it is protect a child. The biggest responsibility is of the parents, even with classification
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-011646-012021 There is a classification of a movie for example -PG thirteen
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-011673-011758 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-012048-012657 It is your responsibility when you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-012653-012733 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-012657-013047 It is because you let him. You thought what can be done.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-013039-013141 Exactly
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-013119-013253 One who puts the classifications already has it then
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-014283-014677 Yes, we believe more or less the same thing. In the end the responsibility of raising and taking care of them and wanting them to see or not see
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-015312-015550 Your sons, or your family You as a mother or your husband as a mother.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-015862-016125 I believe that I agree. Normally the children have access to television when the parents are out.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-016864-017043 Exactly
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-016869-017035 The kids are alone
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-017043-017148 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-017057-017748 There is no father to teach them or tell them, you should not watch this.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-017728-017961 If they go to a sleepover, you don't know either
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-018021-018096 No because you don't have any idea
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-018225-018857 If they go to a sleepover and the watch a movie, they watch a movie and they don't have any control at that house, or whatever
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-018857-019017 You don't know either
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-019023-019125 Exactly
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-019097-019465 I believe it is important to give to your children one good principles at home.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-020046-020110 Sure
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-020519-020836 I dont like and you are nor ready or the time will come
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-021309-021606 They cannot have them in a crystal box
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-021573-021760 No
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-021606-021955 Exposed
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-021835-021910 Yes, also when the children reach a certain age. My son was seventeen years old. He tells me, don't worry because you did better than you could do.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-023228-023314 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-023250-023592 It is twenty-five percent genes and education.  The rest is the decision of my life
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-024326-024680 Look, with that that
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-024707-024851 Then I learned
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-025275-025510 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-025360-025532 My cellphone was ringing. Let me answer
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-026083-026196 Okay
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-026105-026555 Don't hang up on me because we have to talk for twelve minutes.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-026576-026663 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-026812-026919 I only went to turn it off.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-027123-027396 Okay
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-027230-027723 I love to watch horror movies.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-027900-028017 OK
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-028023-028339 There are times I get scared I'm an adult.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-028580-028955 You scare yourself
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-028800-029357 I get scared from horror movies.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-028955-029116 But your responsibility is to watch it and scare yourself
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-029919-030021 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-029967-030433 I don't like them and I don't watch them, I don't watch any of that type. That's why it's also my decision be- even though I'm old enough to watch it, if it's too violent, I don't want to watch it
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-030889-030948 Yes, that's why I respect what my son told me that time, fifty percent is responsibility,
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-031526-031676 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-031783-032067 Of the individual, you already did the best you could. Then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen at the.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-032839-033096 That some are much more mature than normal
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-033069-033171 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-033112-033396 They start seeing rated R movies.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-033369-033503 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-033444-033739 At around fourteen and fifteen years old and the PG-thirteen the kids that are eleven and twelve years old are already seeing them.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-034371-034628 Yes there.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-034398-034585 Sometimes even the little ones. Sometimes the much younger ones. I remember Jenny's little friend that used to watch Harry Potter.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-035158-035400 Already thirteen already
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-035405-035630 Jenny doesn't like [PG-13 or -14] because she gets scared.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-036176-036316 Yeah
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-036267-036573 She gets scared with the monsters and all that.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-036326-036562 Yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-036685-036830 The major part is the criteria that you form. Take care of them and don't let them watch television when they are by themselves.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-037901-038250 Yes, because
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-038051-038298 Don't leave them alone with the t.v.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-038276-038566 We can't control them
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-038426-038689 It's the television more.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-038587-039225 That's what I'm telling you.  You can control them. You can't see this movie because of this reason.  You need to be more mature.  Whatever you want to tell them, it's not true.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-039562-039921 You have to formulate criteria to go and see some movies.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-039862-040285 Yes, that's why I'm telling you you don't get nothing out in telling them. You can't see that. Because there will come a time in which they go to a friend's house.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-040848-041175 In the same school they show them movies
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-040976-041525 Or the same school, but the same school is under a little more supervision because that's another thing. Because, because there is a goal.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-041625-041855 They show them documental
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-041746-041929 What I fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses. They have the television right there, that's used a lot, or the computer.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-042858-043212 And they have access to the information without the parents, And they are in the piece and the parents think they are listening to music
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-043902-044247 Maybe they are watching something non-adequate. son or daughter
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-044787-045116 Is presented to that situation, it needs to learn to value itself. And learn to answer to that. That's what I say, therefore trying to give the values of the house
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-045616-045723 Keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and killed himself
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-046173-046923 My, of course, because you know they are not ready for that
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-046189-046307 It wanted to fly. I don't want to ask you a question.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-046950-047116 None
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-047062-047426 Did you read the rules for this game, the telephone game
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-047742-048069 Yes, OK
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-048530-049012 I was wondering who is this?are you ready for Christmas already?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-049449-049893 Yes, yes, yes I'm getting ready, buying the presents for the family. But now I have another thing in my mind
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-050201-050400 Of course about your birthday no
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-050356-051000 Yes I'm buying presents for the nieces. I have them ready, the adults are left yet.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-051512-051860 Buy things for the adults, an antencion, although I'll make most of the presents
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-052210-052398 That's what I was going to tell you
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-052212-052396 I'm going to cook, yes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-052408-052607 You showed me how to sew.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-052781-053098 Yes also for some children too.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-053089-053373 Not that thing in the table.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-053098-053209 Yes, but I don't have time yet to wait until the middle of the week in Decemeber to do it.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-053914-054091 Because they are
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-053962-054212 I don't use it.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-054160-054321 That is beautiful.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-054305-054633 Yes. So that is what I'm going to do. That's why I'm going to do some gifts. Andreita, it is about to be her birthday soon.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-055519-055928 Two days before Miranda.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-055532-055741 It's Andreita's birthday too.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-056098-056626 Yes it's true, , I thought that more have some nice memories in life about the achievements that you had
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-056228-056325 I remember it was about three days.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-056676-056870 Three days from the twenty four. I have a little gift for her. I bought her the same as Miranda.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-057482-057712 What did you buy to Miranda?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-057733-058159 A screen like those that you draw and then you erase.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-058114-058425 It's nice
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-058324-059153 Because she likes, she already knew them and she likes them, she makes little dashes and then she erases them and, I'm not going to give them to her yet because they are very small and she puts them in the mouth.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-059153-059591 The screen and the pencil yes, I will.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-059416-059705 That's nice.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-059591-059871 Yes, because of little things like this.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-059839-060176 What a feeling.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-060048-060230 Sure. You really enjoy to do those kinds of things. Then I brought the same to Andreita. And with that already,
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-061001-061205 And do you know who else's birthday.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-061039-061301 Okay who
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-061237-061403 The same date
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-061333-061505 Who?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-061435-061623 Until I remember when i was there
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-061532-061826 My father-in-law
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-061660-061939 Your father-in-law
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-061837-062014 It is true
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-061982-062400 Juan Luis Sandra's younger son.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-062073-062925 Oh yes, okay
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-062475-062791 Also the twenty nine. I also remember that, more or less in the same date,everybody were in there in the same date.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-063348-063717 I don't remember
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-063669-063932 No, you went to the Carlistos girl's birthday party
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-064232-064537 I have not gone to a birthday in Sandra's house. I went to one, surely, I don't remember, really.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-064767-065394 You went to Chile and left her a present for her birthday.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-065276-065576 Was in April, so, I went to Chile in April
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-065560-065887 She is three.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-065646-065850 And i left the gift in that place
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-066139-066471 Yes, for her nephew who came later
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-066375-066744 He came and told me that he received it from her afterwards.  But not his name
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-067001-067339 No but Sandra won't throw a party this year for her birthday
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-067307-067542 No okay
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-067403-068035 No, she said that family only, because they will buy something better for the kid. So
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-068025-068164 Yes, it's true
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-068094-068464 She makes really big parties
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-068437-068716 It gets away from her hands, yes.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-068608-069085 She spends too much on that and they cannot buy the kid what he
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-069091-069471 What he wants
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-069155-069321 They have to decide between the two things, so this year they decided that only the family
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-070446-070698 So he could get a more special present
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-070692-070842 For a better gift
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-070762-071014 Juan Luis is the big one or the small one?
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-070955-071126 The smallest.
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-071110-071298 Yeah
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-071191-071625 And he always says that he doesn't want any clothes
20051113_155059_492_fsp-B-071614-071812 Poor boy!
20051113_155059_492_fsp-A-071651-071844 He doesn't want books, only toys
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-000000-000121 Carolina
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-000100-000258 Tamara.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-000268-000479 Tamara how are you?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-000416-000601 Yes, and you?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-000516-000780 Where are you?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-000738-001012 I am in the State of Washington,Seattle
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-000927-001281 I am in Los Angeles, wow!
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-001239-001428 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-001365-001644 Yes, incredible.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-001550-001666 Yes
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-001660-001929 I was making a call and I did not think today was Sunday, I was half asleep and oh my God!
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-002509-002799 Yes, they got me off guard. Do you have time participating here?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-003063-003458 Yes, I believe my twenty third call.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-003416-003975 It is almost ready  just half almost to the tenth
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-003954-004391 Yes, and this is the second time I do this service with them.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-004312-004824 Yes, I casually received mail from them that they are accepting persons to participate. In the beginning, only one time you could participate.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-005704-005794 Yes
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-005746-006247 According to the mail that was sent this is going to be continued
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-006717-006796 Yes I am
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-006796-006885 Rather, yes please tell me
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-006985-007449 What do you think about what they showin the movies?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-007017-007075 I stopped watch movie but go to cinema for over a year
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-008404-008546 Not too conventional
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-008546-008662 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-008578-009036 We switch to movies, for example in the case of the movies just like on television. Now we see movies kind of documentaries. This with another kind of message then.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-009833-009959 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-009891-010254 You watch movies that are infestivals, here there is one for example, recently ended the Latin American International Film Festival
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-011219-011446 It was
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-011235-011525 Yeah
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-011483-011557 Hello!
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-011546-011847 No, I am not here on my computer, sorry
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-011720-011873 This approximately a month or less than a month ago, because since a long time we decided we were not going to continue wasting time
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-013123-013539 Most of the movies were stupid or absurd; and we didn't want to waste our money.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-014446-014536 OK
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-014472-014567 Watching a type of movies that really dont give you anything
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-014994-015316 Yes because there are lots of movies so, I have noticed
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-015200-015311 Yes
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-015337-015732 Yes I like a, around here where I live there uste to be one of those ah like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-016254-016355 Smaller
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-016365-016492 OK
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-016370-016824 People like the movies, documentaries and other stuff which they had with them and they're talking about. As a result, the big stores got closed as people don't go to watch around.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-017462-017562 Sure
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-017541-017810 Those are the best ones, I can find movies I like, my husband is from America, but he likes international movies too
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-018437-018674 More important things to say
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-018690-018922 Exactly!
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-018796-019075 I have young children and sometimes they want to see movies and we take them, but usually no. Before, we used to go two or three times a month
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-019866-019998 Yeah
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-019898-020304 We reduced it, so it's once or twice every two months.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-020330-020752 We went to the movies very often and some day we watched a movie
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-021500-021680 Stupid, so dumbt hat I felt angry for being at the movies. I was wondering why we were wasting our time there?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-022449-022945 We started getting information about other kind of movies and we changed  to that movie.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-023514-023815 In one of those cases, we are kind of intellectuals now, because we arrived at that point where we feel like
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-024379-024537 What are you doing? I mean, to watch this, I honestly prefer to go to sleep, or do something else instead. Not all movies, there are some that have
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-025502-025713 I feel they're making movies just for the sake of making movies rather than movies worth watching with different content.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-026446-026599 Yeah, exactly and in general I think that eighty percent of the movies are bad, that you must not see them
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-026609-027205 We
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-027548-027848 Making them up as they go along. Where are you from?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-027811-027917 I'm from Panama.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-027954-028165 I'm from Venezuela
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-028133-028407 Okay
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-028244-028502 Yes
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-028423-028766 If it is real
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-028581-029172 Yes make the movies how you want but some may come out good and other may not
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-029594-029926 Honestly no And the same is happening right now with the television we had cable and recently in a matter of a month we cut it off because  all of sudden
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-030848-030991 We see that there was a lot of manipulation in the media they only give you the news they want and hide what they want
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-031787-031840 That is a level of news and movies. It is not good money.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-032899-033147 They were repeating Oh my God what is this we are paying for.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-034154-034318 The means of communication are like this
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-034571-035029 Yes right what you say. I am here, my husband and I we watch news.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-034613-034692 I believe.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-035066-035456 Because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-035446-035562 Exactly
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-035478-035768 They exagerate a lot
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-035773-035910 Exactly.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-035783-036242 Because when I was, we would be in Panama before Noriega got out.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-036237-036384 Just imagine.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-036247-036516 And we were over there and my husband, you know that white man bought paper with my dad is dark and my mom is white and I came out dark like my dad like what
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-037497-037724 When we went out did you know he was American.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-037724-037908 Logic
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-037745-038340 We would go in both. we would go in for whatever we had to go, he to go to the military base and I had to go with him or something like that.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-038351-038446 Of course
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-038362-038588 When we got home, we turned the TV on.  There was a bunch of things going on in Panama, and, I looked at him.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-039089-039274 I do not remember if we were over there this morning watching any of that.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-039506-039822 Exactly.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-039590-039991 And the next day it was the same, and I say: what an ex-agent! I think they were showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating like that, what
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-040402-040571 Exactly
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-040481-040808 He doesn't want to believe what the tv says.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-040808-040971 Exactly.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-040834-041288 Don't believe everything the TV says
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-041209-041451 Exactly
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-041335-041551 It's not true
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-041462-041857 Incidentally I borrowed a movie that's called the Panama's deception or Panama's Defense
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-042226-042358 Right
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-042279-042680 We were watching the whole documentary, and i would never imagined that it was so sad
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-043502-043676 So ugly what happened
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-043655-044103 That was the documentary where they spoke about that man that got his head cut off.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-043713-043792 And I have become accustomed to having a cellular telelphone.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-044209-044240 It isn't remembered
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-044319-044557 What I can remember is that night,when they bombed and a lot of people died.  Even so, a few days ago they showed a
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-045653-045748 I recall now during our President's visit
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-046022-046133 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-046049-046170 He was there and the people was protesting that Why? the current President did nothing to remember the victims of that sector
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-047035-047430 I think they were names 'Los de Richos', 'de Chinos' in the sector where practically the whole town disappeared. I
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-047957-048031 Del churillo
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-048068-048121 Del Chorrillo, exactly
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-048448-049191 Yes, that's where the police station's located.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-048833-049128 Things happened in Venezuela happened here.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-049929-050251 Things are put here in Venezuela happened long time ago
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-050852-050968 Univision. That aren't so shameless, don't put those things there; that was not reality, the first thing people tell you: eh! And that President
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-051811-052017 He is nuts. What happens is the information is being twisted and he is shown like a monster
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-052892-053045 A dictator, and we have been through four elections and four Referendum. It is not possible to be more democracy. He has a personality that
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-054089-054395 He is not a common person and people don't accept that.  He is the first to be critical of all that stuff.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-055297-055434 Yes, that.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-055328-055428 I don't know if you have heard him
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-055734-055840 No because I don't get to much in that news stuff, sometimes
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-056293-056383 Look there is a page on the internet where you can watch television from all the countries including Panama

20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-058397-058550 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-058465-058771 TV number four
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-058760-059029 TV or TV for all
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-058956-059224 Exactly there you go

20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-059325-059483 It is dot com.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-059441-059536 OK
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-059557-059836 I see the Venezuelan television
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-060827-061297 I watch the channel from the government there. Because the other channels are from the opposition and more of the same.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-061845-062161 But I like to watch to see what horrific things they are saying.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-062193-062314 OK
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-062209-062330 I compared and now I have this internet page, so I don't turn on the television. Now we are stuck with watching channels from the internet.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-063347-063485 The world is comparing what is going on. Even with community radio you feel you are.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-064618-064813 Are saying truly the truth or at least the other side of the coin, let's not say it's the truth a hundred per cent because sometimes it's not
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-065451-065741 It's not that you can say everything others say
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-065973-066068 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-065989-066390 Good heavens! truly they manipulate it too much.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-066390-066521 Yes
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-066411-066506 I don't know if you
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-066590-066653 Say?
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-066590-066685 You gave yourself a, I don't know if you watched a movie called Auto fox
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-067286-067613 No, maybe, I don't remember.
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-067449-068040 It's a documentary about those who work in Fox News
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-068050-068130 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-068145-068630 And they practically force them to say what it's not and then they decided to resign from the channel and besides resigning, they got together and started to protest at a level
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-069695-069933 At the local level to tell the world what was going on inside Fox News. It's very interesting; it's called
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-070971-071182 The Fox Workers that are Out
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-071219-071282 Some
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-071319-071472 Out of outside
20051113_210221_496_fsp-A-071488-071652 None
20051113_210221_496_fsp-B-071620-071757 And Fox from Fox News
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-000000-000151 My name is
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-000007-000214 Hi, my name is Fernanda
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-000192-000472 Hi Fernanda, how are you?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-000472-000573 How are you?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-000475-000871 Where are yo talking...fine, Where are yo talking from?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-000831-001016 From Washington
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-001008-001304 Oh, which one?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-001235-001448 Washington DC
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-001402-001786 Because there are two of them, right?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-001784-001973 Yes, Washington State
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-001842-001938 And the other one
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-002064-002320 Where are you from?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-002158-002256 I'm talking from Idaho, i don't know if you know it
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-002600-002797 Yes, of course.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-002800-003070 Yes, personally I don't believe much about ratings. For my point of view, the ratings don't go the way i suppose they would
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-004267-004568 They don't know how to rate them. Sometimes they said that it is a PG movie, but when you watch it
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-005435-005652 Has rude things, and pornography, and sometimes something stronger like a PG-13 is more quiet
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-006678-006979 And doesn't have that many nude scenes or bad language.  Personally, I don't care about those ratings, sometimes it just
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-007612-007871 Dont know. People who rate those movies don't know how to rate them, or I don't know what are their point of view.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-008360-008694 I really don't know that much about movies because
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-008643-008714 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-008699-009133 I don't have children or anything like that, so I barely ever notice
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-008863-008941 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-009145-009309 What classification?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-009305-009414 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-009385-009737 I think that the majority of TV, if you watch during the middle of the day that is when many times children are at home
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-010091-010200 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-010181-010467 Are things that are not appropriate for most
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-010503-010587 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-010601-010736 And I think that Americans have -- moral standards have gone down
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-011335-011449 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-011442-011666 Many things already are normal that should not be.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-011916-012310 Yes, yes it is true because, I don't have cable, the regular channels, the ones one can watch
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-013019-013085 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-013051-013385 But for example, I got to have one, cable one time and sometimes it was, well, which ones do you like? ten am, eleven, and well I  like to be changing the channel
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-014272-014685 To be choosing the program I am going to see for that time
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-014696-014782 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-014729-014852 And sometimes they air movies that a ten or nine year old boy was at home and was watching and changing it too at the same time.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-016055-016292 Stop on that channel  there were things  for adults already
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-016617-016716 Sure
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-016631-016904 Thinking about the children, I said I'm married for three years with a boy who is almost two.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-017744-017825 OK
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-017768-017989 In any case, my son is going to grow up and this may get worse. Then
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-018232-018356 Of course
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-018406-018751 What kind of cartoons they are going to watching television. i am from maxico city
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-019541-019640 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-019551-019746 It was ten at night. Then I turned on the cable and I learned the
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-020565-020812 To the channel that here is sixteen, then there was a cartoon in English. Because at night they show some in English, some in Spanish
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-021616-021852 And there were cartoons in English. Then I told him. And, my mom was quiet because he was watching the cartoon channel.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-022570-022875 He cartoons started to show up naked
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-022870-022951 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-022877-023134 The cartoon was starting to do things, the two cartoon figures. It was a cartoon and it was ten at night, my mom told me
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-023532-023628 What a horror
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-023847-024007 She turned the television off and she had to explain a bit because of my mom. It surprised her because I had tuned to a normal channel.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-025330-025660 Not even cartoons are safe.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-025891-026378 Yes and that could happen to any child who was watching television.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-025893-026072 Sometimes cartoons yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-026412-026691 You cannot either be on top  let's say if the kid changes you cannot jump to see  you have to trust that at least during the day
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-027226-027322 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-027286-027688 Programming does not contain nudity or curse words
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-027727-027957 Yes, it's true but really it's not the cartoons.  The Japanese cartoons are the ones that have more classification.  In Mexico,
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-029196-029320 In Cablevision and Multivision in Mexico hasn't all those restrictions with normal channels.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-030567-030858 Yes, it has more restrictions. Not so much now on the other cables. and, in tv's, for example, normal of children's channel
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-031980-032172 Of television like any channel. For example, what is the five in cartoons?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-032560-032623 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-032598-032891 You can watch TV at ten o'clock.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-033376-033677 In Mexico District
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-033444-033577 Before, in Mexico. But for example, if you're watching a cable channel now you risk the cartoon possibly being something sometimes some kind of
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-034330-034577 Pornography thing or with more nudity.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-034625-035014 Yes, I'm Colombian, and I think that in Colombia neither
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-034649-034831 So right
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-035016-035350 The TV is a lot better than here in that way.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-035310-035406 Right
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-035388-035542 At ten pm, the shows they put on are never so you're at risk for them to be as bad as here.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-036262-036356 Right
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-036502-036975 Here not even at ten or at any other hour. Are you risking to watch anything else ?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-036961-037200 Yes, that's true the other I was with a neighbor, and imagine, i was with a neighbor, it was twelve and a half p.m.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-038102-038207 HER KID WAS WATCHING A CARTOON CHANNEL SHE WANTED TO CHANGE ANOTHER AND IT WAS ALSO A PROGRAMME FOR KIDS
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-039413-039544 Well there has a program were there was a girl that showed the adventures of a girl and that was, in a hospital
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-040513-040775 They were showing how her mom was having her little brother in the hospital
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-041264-041426 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-041408-041623 I explained to her and her mother that there's no problem, it's a channel of
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-042372-042769 Honestly  it didn't leave much to the imagination.  it was like an operation room where the woman was having her baby.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-044143-044229 What horror
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-044566-044728 They are six years old.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-044775-044850 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-044791-045179 They are six year old twins.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-045830-046067 I don't want to explain too much to my children in that moment
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-046971-047066 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-047128-047373 There are babysitters that you don't have control over and you're not in the house to see.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-047509-047594 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-048027-048197 You don't know what they're watching, that they go to their friends or whatever.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-048299-048451 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-048545-048636 I think
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-048615-048935 It's one of those classifications that they have
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-049645-049975 They don't leave anything to the imagination. They show it right away.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-050001-050120 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-050030-050120 Now at any time of the day and you go and watch soap operas. I don't like watching soap operas. But, you see
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-050921-051523 Many moms are at home and they have little children three, four years old, five or more or they're at home and they're watching their soap opera
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-051885-052182 And they're always show scenes where they are, the couple, they're there having relations.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-052417-052589 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-052501-052669 In the middle of the day, because soap operas are on from six in the morning until nightfall.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-053090-053246 Of course.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-053172-053374 And that's how they are. So now they don't leave anything to the imagination.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-053676-053893 No.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-053701-054231 The programs, are classified, to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal. And for many
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-054914-054976 Parents unfortunately are making it normal.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-055324-055470 Exactly
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-055350-055518 If the parents spole to this television station and demand that there were more strict programs to pricacies of scenes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-056926-057197 I believe that they would decrease a little. If their children see something like that, it's okay.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-057684-057942 It doesn't matter to them.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-057688-057835 Teaching. And so, these things of classifications I don't like. And I believe it doesn't matter to the producers. I feel that to them it's beneficial because
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-059133-059500 If a movie has a sex scene or some crudeness, people but it and they even laugh
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-060137-060419 Or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene. So really, these things sometimes even help more
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-061136-061263 Producers to sell
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-061238-061435 None
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-061314-061478 If that's the case, no. For me in particular, they type of movies I like are Disney movies,
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-062263-062459 Children's movies. I like them.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-062375-062567 Yes.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-062467-062601 Even though I am tired I love all of this.  I have Disney movies around here.  Sincerely, I do not live the movies.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-063525-063823 I am going to have more kids and while I am not going to be
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-064642-064894 And at least that if they are going to put on a movie, well that it is at least a decent movie. That it does not have so many things.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-065282-065514 Of course
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-065364-065725 So while we have those from Disney they are going to have pornography?
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-066075-066414 Yes he/she does not know how they are going to change
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-066248-066360 Yes then already, this is the truth, this is bringing the truth far as it already goes, you turn on the television and if you already see a commercial.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-067628-067771 Of feminine towels, and it seems fine, well until almost, they're going to explain to your know, while they're goin to put a naked woman and they're going to.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-068360-068595 Put there, how she is placing the towel.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-068598-069002 Exactly
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-068647-068868 Sometimes they show it to you. I don't know if you have seen the commercials? It frightens you because you are big.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-069587-069985 But if a boy or girl is seeing it, for example, and if it's the mom, you can answer:well fine. If it's the friend (boy or girl)
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-070611-070842 Then you tell them and can explain to him/her the bad information.
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-071119-071450 And that one becomes accustomed to it, do you understand me? We say
20051113_214925_498_fsp-B-071147-071258 Yes
20051113_214925_498_fsp-A-071465-071545 Sometimes I see and that one does not realize how they have changed things
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-000021-000275 Good evening my name is Marzia from Philadelphia.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-000026-000129 Hello, my name is Juan. You are Marisol
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-000632-000787 Mariza, Mariza.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-000669-001092 I see Mariza, we talked a few days ago I think, no.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-001103-001366 Maybe yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-001275-001516 I could be, I am in San Antonio, Texas
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-001408-001558 In San Antonio, yes.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-001601-001858 Listen, the theme today is about religion.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-002073-002566 Yes, that is a complicated and very controversial theme
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-002191-002260 The need of religion is something that we all have
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-003278-003369 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-003508-003867 The institution tried this like any other need.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-003519-003739 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-003926-004082 Give us an answer.  The ends have been like a way to control.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-004467-004810 Yes, today in this country.  In the United States there are a lot of problems regarding religion, it is a mix with politics and right side people that want to have control.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-005626-005967 Tried to control the country in base of religion also and, it can be positive or it can be negative to many people, it help to pray or believe, help in others, of others
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-006751-007293 In other way, the, the, the Christians is the most powerful religion in the world and there a more, let's say that have power to have influence in politicians, to the countries
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-007800-008192 Es, let's see in this case, for example here where I live, I went to a church
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-008512-008581 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-008530-008657 They express an ideology but regarding a conservative group in the United States, no.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-009857-010017 Yeah
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-009958-010328 Then they exerted a very direct power trying to influence people at the church
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-010842-010928 Yeah
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-010858-011335 With the discourse, it came to my attention against the public schools
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-011389-011469 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-011416-012000 Directly against the public schools and praying for God to free us from public school some day
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-012042-012133 Really?
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-012112-012300 Because yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-012208-012262 Oh, no.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-012396-013125 About trying to see the theory of evolution
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-013044-013221 I've heard that
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-013194-013553 No, terrible, they said. Why is this excruciating, the teachers that teach the Bible to explain the creation of the world?
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-014292-014582 Exactly, yeah, there are a lot of problems, yeah
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-014437-014732 What I say is that, the Bible doesn't make for an explanation of the world
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-015171-015601 No, everyone can believe what they want. The thing is they try to impose their beliefs on everyone and for the Bible, for what they think
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-015900-016210 Exactly, they're fundamentalisms, no
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-016012-016103 Yes, I know some people from Maracaibo.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-017673-018003 Target of Christians and they are the ones that The people with power in the country, the ones with the companies, everyone is, maybe, there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-018810-019061 The right to abort, the right of homosexuality, gay marriage, the right to the belief of
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-019650-019853 Yes, more scientific, no, you can't just believe what they say, they say god created man and woman, you also have to give a choice for kids to believe
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-020566-020870 That was Charles Darwin who came up with the theory of evolution.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-020957-021039 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-021036-021563 It's really complicated, too. The other question was about homosexuality, yes. If we were all equal or all believed the same thing, there wouldn't be any problems, I was asking.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-022040-022177 But
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-022071-022532 I think more problems, no.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-022580-022670 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-022628-022976 The differences help to complement each other.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-022944-023148 I don't have any
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-023030-023469 The subject of homosexuality is very controversial.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-023394-023464 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-023533-023764 The phenomenon of homosexuality has to be something that we are well informed about, for example used to think
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-025328-026067 Something to do with deviation, but lately I've read homosexuality is a matter of genetics.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-026062-026501 I'm convinced it's that because I know a lot of people that are
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-026121-026217 No
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-026517-026978 Homosexuals or lesbians I'm really informed about. Ever since I was a girl
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-027407-027645 I would accept people for being homosexual and everyone has a right to get married.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-028473-028575 Yes,
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-028570-028718 It is OK for people to be with who ever they want since we are all citizens with the same rights who pay taxes.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-029512-029587 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-029527-029895 They have the right to get married and to live with whomever.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-029625-029721 I agree, they have all the rights and in this case the marriage rights are relatives
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-031366-031762 Well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they don't have rights to marriage, when marriage is really a contract
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-032576-032700 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-032619-032957 Between two persons that stated doing something in common.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-032978-033169 But the church wont see it that way
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-033042-033133 No,
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-033169-033706 Believe it's an abomination because marriage is defined as the union between a woman and a man. People and Christian fundamentalists see it as an abomination, and are closed minded and don't understand that
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-034708-035220 That was before, the tradicional thinking but now times have change and each one also. Same as before, homosexuality has been always, since the beginning of man but before was a way and now is ,
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-035885-036148 Things are more liberal and people are not scared to talk about being homeosexual or gay.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-036792-036936 That is the problem. The Church has a problem but they cannot do anything.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-036953-037050 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-037326-037859 People are accepting the echo from others.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-037891-037976 There is one that is so extreme. The ecclesiastic institution , the blessing of God for marriage when in reality
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-039396-039905 Well the church and religion is a way of institution,
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-039857-039930 Right.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-039937-040307 The need to change and find new ways to learn things of life
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-040666-040734 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-040682-040966 From society and individuals, no.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-040895-041479 The religion has to be something personal,no something that mix with politics
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-041844-042314 Let's see why you don't think the same as me, you are no me like you get punish because we are different, and shouldn't be that, each person can think whatever they want, believe in anything or anyone, don't have
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-043094-043267 For the Christians, because they talk badly about the Musilims. They say they are radicals or they talk badly about the atheist. They don't believe in god and they call them heretic or,
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-044002-044108 But I don't know.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-044046-044148 Right
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-044108-044659 That is very christian, you have to accept the people like they are, and each and everyone one of them that believes or has your religion, but that is the problem with the fundamentalists, that they don't accept the differences.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-045273-045610 Yes, but in that case, accepting the difference seems like something that has to do with the matter of humanity right
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-046194-046257 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-046253-046933 Like one paradox not being able to accept the difference
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-046617-046749 In this country christian families say that they raise their children in a manner that,when they are very little they teach them to be like that
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-048134-048781 When they are older  people are different
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-048781-048908 Radicals don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-048942-049076 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-049452-050113 For example, I was lucky to travel a lot and meet people of different races, cultures, so I am open to everything.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-050132-050276 Right
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-050164-050373 When I see a person, I immediately know by looking at them, this person will not accept me because I'm not like them. I don't think or look the same.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-051362-051819 But is that there are classes there are people of different classes, and there has to be radicals Christians there has to be everything, but I think that yes, religion does influence the country, yes.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-052558-053105 What fascinates me is that in this case
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-052725-052801 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-053148-053244 In this country, being so fundamentalist
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-053587-053662 Yes I am
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-053598-054316 With the churches, there is a great proportion of fundamentalist even in the discourse of the president himself there are fundamentalists
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-053946-054026 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-054396-054589 Not there,
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-054517-055591 The message is very clear and it's already been five years in government and when Bill Clinton was in office, he was more open. Of course he was a leftist, more
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-055591-055839 This government doesn't have the religious Christians of the right to understand more people's concerns
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-056699-057191 There is such a polemic with marriages
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-057766-058134 It's expected of Catholics to not agree with abortion, but I don't agree with that during this day and age.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-058832-058955 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-058885-059703 They want things go backwards, they go back instead of going forward and they want things to become as they were thirty or forty years ago but that cannot be.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-059769-060051 That's how we are now.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-060037-060525 Do you practice any religion in particular?
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-060439-060669 My family are from Spain, I'm Catholic. As soon as you're born they baptize you, first communion, I got married in the church.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-061242-061344 Sure.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-061376-062160 I have my beliefs, but I don't go to church, to mass every Sunday, neither do I practice, I believe
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-062160-062645 But let's say that I carry it on my own, let's say that I carry faith with me, I don't
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-062416-062523 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-062645-062811 Neither am I. I'm very open and my beliefs are contradictory, although I am Catholic.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-063567-063653 Yes, the same with me, as I get closer to the Catholic church there is a feeling of integration and community.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-065178-065477 Created interest in everyone, it seems
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-065448-065732 There is much economic interest
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-065562-065676 No then.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-065732-066337 The problem is that it goes right away that they are not interested on the followers, they are interested on money, and
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-065773-065860 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-066337-066845 Also they don't look like believers either. There have been many child abuse cases and things like that.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-067193-067556 How can a priest do that to a child?
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-067853-067891 Yes
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-068197-068293 I don't know that each person is free to believe what he wants, and practice it, but respecting others who are not the same.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-069214-069310 None
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-069262-069675 Because there are many religions and what happens is that the Christian religion is the most let's say abundant in the world, it is the more, the one that has the power on everything
20051114_181749_505_fsp-B-070108-070617 Because on this side of the world, I believe there are more Muslims than Christians.
20051114_181749_505_fsp-A-071223-071548 They don't have as much economic power. That is the problem.

20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-005179-005304 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-005217-005565 When I lived in Columbia, I got stuck with the Bogota Spanish.

20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-044657-044885 Of course, but here in the United States.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-044831-045054 Yes, here in the United States
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-044983-045375 Verizon is offering me free calls here in the United States
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-046103-046282 Yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-046125-046271 They give me and in the meantime they charge me.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-046559-047016 If they charge you monthly, you make a lot of calls, it's worthwhile.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-046798-046880 Yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-047048-047554 Some day they will make it international for your favorite country.

20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-047597-048021 You pay a monthly quote and you came make all the calls you want.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-047972-048152 Yes.

20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-048152-048309 It would be excellent for calling the country when one wants
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-049168-049586 Before it was pricey. Remember before? For calling the country of
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-049391-049679 It is cheaper, right?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-049586-049853 Now it is very cheap
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-049717-050005 And why is it cheap? Because of technology.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-049956-050163 Yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-050076-050347 Yes, technology.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-050206-050576 You can now talk for three, four or five hours for five dollars.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-050565-050684 Exactly.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-050576-051010 It was one minute, oh my god it was like eight.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-050847-051135 One minute was twenty cents
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-051092-051500 It cost me like twenty-five dollars.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-051885-052016 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-051934-052152 And I had to be careful a lot have the clock in front of me, no?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-052244-052461 Yes, that has happened to me too.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-052641-052804 Yes
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-052701-052836 Yes, you have to be with the clock
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-053141-053222 Of course, yes
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-053619-053983 Yes, but with
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-053913-054369 Hopefully technology keeps moving ahead. I say in about ten years, what are they going to come up with?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-054684-055000 This has to be moving forward
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-054918-055255 What happens is that it is advancing, and technology is in the hands of more people
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-055260-055347 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-055728-056173 Then services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-056016-056114 Yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-056266-056402 Do you understand?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-056369-056538 Of course
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-056407-056673 For example, the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-057032-057211 Exactly, yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-057086-057347 Now you can buy a computer for $200-300
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-057505-057750 Yeah, true. Ha.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-057722-058010 Because there's more demand.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-057777-057869 Of course
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-058038-058255 Because technology has advanced.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-058532-058657 Of course, that's true.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-058619-058896 What i would like to see is
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-058711-058755 Yeah
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-058896-059211 More advanced technology, with medicine.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-059260-059369 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-059266-059548 They have to find cures for things like cancer. If you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? They could make a
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-060032-060157 True.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-060271-060440 Fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-060478-060527 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-060864-061353 I want to see more advances in medicine. I think they're going slow in that area.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-061358-061472 Yeah
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-061456-061760 I haven't really seen so many advances, in diseases in the past 10,20,30,40 years.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-061782-061891 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-062195-062309 Good
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-062233-062548 It's true, because of the cancer and how many years it has
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-062532-062760 Yes, it kills many people, right?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-062554-062760 We did not find the cure.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-062929-063288 That shortens the lives of many people.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-063021-063135 Yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-063342-063641 Heart disease
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-063586-063668 AIDS is widespread across many areas.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-064081-064489 AIDS is more advanced than cancer, in
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-064423-064592 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-064489-064858 In the sense of control because you have to have the drugs to fight it.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-064842-064951 Yes, yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-064880-065190 The cancer is very slow
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-065130-065293 Yeah.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-065244-065538 You've heard of adiscovery for cancer?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-065494-065820 No, it's not true.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-065548-065684 Nothing
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-065847-065961 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-065847-065989 Very slow.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-066092-066152 Yes
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-066228-066467 That could be improved

20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-066527-066641 Yes.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-066586-066788 I hope that  God may enlighten them, so they can find something that could cure, for this, this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it does not matter the age
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-068320-068500 Yes
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-068385-068635 It can happen to any person.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-068641-069092 I had a friend that died very young, at thirty-two years of age, and got cancer from one day to another.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-069108-069201 Yes
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-069434-069635 And she died in three days.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-069592-070010 In three days?
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-069842-070233 Because she got cerebral bleeding
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-070217-070445 Oh, my God.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-070271-070597 And and she died immediately, she had leukemia, of the blood.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-070695-070896 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-070891-071184 And of that, she got it from one day to the next
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-071201-071353 Oh my God.
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-071309-071467 There was nothing they could do
20051115_212123_516_fsp-A-071711-071820 None
20051115_212123_516_fsp-B-071722-071951 I don't know, no
