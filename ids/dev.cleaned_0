20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-018722-018839 Of course.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-018844-019197 But I have an uncle who is a Christian

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-019450-020264 But, often when I go to Puerto Rico, he wants me to change religion to their orthodoxy, because they say that orthodoxy
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-019915-019996 Yes

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-026537-026613 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-026577-026770 In that aspect, women are beautiful. They don't even have to dress up, because they are not going to go like that all the time.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-026951-027073 Natural
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-027240-027538 Exactly.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-027528-027593 None

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-028973-029024 Aha.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-029277-029610 So yes, but there are people who get bothered a lot.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-029565-029676 Uh huh.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-029620-029807 Sometimes they don't greet anyone
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-029802-029873 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-029838-030060 They have their manner of thinking and sometimes they are very stubborn
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-030368-030465 I unnderstand
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-030429-030763 So it is as I say
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-030768-030844 None

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-031410-031652 I took them to the church
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-031612-031708 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-031678-032138 We were waiting. The first turn that touched the American people.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-032527-032613 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-032567-032997 We were waiting and behind me was an Hispanic lady
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-032936-033063 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-033007-033674 That was speaking about if the lady would be leaving, if she believed that she was going to a party, and if her clothing would be very
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-033887-034645 Very colorful to go to a church, and her shoes were very high, that is she was so fixed up, it seemed that
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-033907-034003 Yes
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-034650-035135 She was going to, to a party that didn't seem to be in a church.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-034655-034721 Yes
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-035171-035368 I looked at her and said,
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-035272-035398 Yes
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-035378-035757 If she loves God, why would she be talking about that.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-035727-036318 You have to groom yourself to attend, as if you are going to a party.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-035903-036015 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-036318-036818 It has nothing to do with God. When you go to church, you have to look nice.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-037344-037460 Exactly.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-037496-037764 Gossiping about other people is somthing you should not do.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-037673-037814 Yes.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-037829-038082 But I looked at her and said, Wow.  My God.  If she talks like that here, how does she.....
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-038198-038279 Yes.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-046913-047595 But my family stayed there in Puerto Rico. I have my mom there, my brothers,

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-052695-053312 My young siblings went to Puerto Rico. I stayed here because I got married.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-052963-053019 Yes.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-053363-053782 But, my mom was coming and going. But, my mom doesn't like it here because of the cold.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-053772-054085 I have heard that Chicago is pretty cold
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-053843-053929 But no, and she says that it's better that she is here placed in four corners, and in Puerto Rico she can be leaving and entering the house.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-054894-054970 Yes

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-059256-059529 And my grandfather, and my papa, and my uncle, they didn't like
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-059262-059358 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-059615-059959 Because he says that women should not use pants

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-060409-061021 He says that women should not use pants, because the pants were made for men.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-060475-060556 Yes.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-062855-062972 Mhm.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-063523-063750 I say to him to believe in God, you do not have to be seven days a week in church
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-064412-064620 Of course Madam
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-064564-064857 He is in church seven days a week.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-064862-064963 Yes.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-064923-065393 On Saturday, he says he's going to Church from the early morning.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-065383-065469 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-065408-065833 Until the night, and all day Sunday in church.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-065974-066065 Yes ma'am.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-066798-066909 Of course.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-066909-067208 But, my uncle goes seven days a week.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-067450-067566 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-067668-067935 When I go to Puerto Rico, I always tell him
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-067703-067784 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-067956-068446 God, he's by our side twenty four hours a day.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-068436-068562 Of course.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-068446-068764 I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk to God, because even in your own bed, you can talk with God.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-069229-069351 Yes mam
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-069280-069629 One can't continue asking God alone. We only remember God when we have problems and not all of the time.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-069912-070023 Is
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-070362-070518 But there are some people that
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-070412-070488 Yes
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-070518-070817 My God that is, my God that grants me to be. When we are good, we don't have problems.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-071221-071337 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-071262-071545 I don't believe that father God exists
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-071499-071631 I see
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000020-000136 Hi?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-000116-000307 Hi. Milgred from Connecticut.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000287-000550 It's Mercedes, from Florida
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-000524-000706 How are you, good night
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000635-000913 Good night, too.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-000777-000857 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000928-001211 Let's see what we can talk about religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-001150-001594 Do you believe that join or disjoints?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-001695-001892 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-001756-002068 Or do you believe that if everybody were the same religion, we would be better or be equal? Or will it be
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-002386-002820 What I believe is that
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-002487-002694 The word will be better?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-002820-003007 Somebody being the same religion that all we be the same religion it's impossible, because I think that always are going to be differences,cultural
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-003567-003724 Yeah, yeah
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-003628-003825 And that always is going to make it that each person interprets that unique religion in its own way
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-004486-004763 I believe that it may be the same because we are all different races.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-005222-005429 It's doctrine, and although we are Hispanic some of us adquire another that in sometimes some of us are a catholic family, and others in the family are
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-006706-006958 Adventists or they are evangelical
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-007402-007544 YES
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-007493-007640 Or they are from the others. The ones of the taballas, the ones who sell... oh, what's their name? I forgot their name.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-008916-009451 There is a lot of races and religions?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-009633-009764 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-009744-010102 I don't get bothered with other religions. I share with any other religion as long as they don't try to put me in something I don't want.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-010980-011283 Not including you.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-011263-011520 Not being fanatics right.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-011283-011596 They oppose it. Don't feel forced, right?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-011566-011677 Yeah
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-011707-011904 I think the religion is separated because of difference.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-013276-013735 People usually believe there are always differences.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-013670-013912 Yeah, religion is like politics.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-013857-014074 Exactly.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-013947-014497 That depends on what point you look at it from.  Well, the entire work will be in agreement.  You understand?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-014366-014492 That is why they say that one should never discuss religion. I can't believe they put us to discuss religion in this show.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-015290-015441 I have aunts and cousins who belong the evangelic religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-016516-016627 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-016622-016935 And the rest of them are Catholics.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-016915-017036 Hm
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-017026-017485 And on the other side of my family, there are some who are absent.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-017455-017535 Hm
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-017485-017813 No one is talking about religion or that you have to change
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-018767-019089 And my cousin's husband is an evangelical, you will almost always find him in the church. And she does not belong to the church. And they have a happier marriage than most.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-019917-020396 She's only there for special occasions for mothers
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-021037-021335 They do not celebrate Christmas
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-021582-021759 Who are they?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-021739-021885 Evangelicals.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-021804-021915 Okay
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-021885-022274 Aha, yes, the evangelicals. So my cousin's husband says that he was not married by that religion, but they did get married at the church.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-023015-023222 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-023076-023263 He dances, she drinks, and he accompanied her to work and to the party, where there was a present.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-023969-024055 You haven't told anybody, you still have to stop smoking and you have to quit drinking protein.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-024807-025095 If you make jokes about yourself at the party, rather than getting cranky? You know that this is not a big deal, and you should just have a good time.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-025821-026043 You can get a person like that, but if they become fans, forget about it.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-026957-027179 This is what happened in my house
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-026987-027143 That is
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-027189-027476 Hey, my mom is that religious
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-027426-027532 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-027486-027673 My dad did not believe in church. He never said why.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-027885-028243 Hat is like my cousin
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-028173-028390 We all went to Catholic school.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-028728-028849 Really?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-028773-029015 Christians
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-029293-029429 Uh
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-029379-029480 That is what we learned in school, we didn't reinforce at home.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-030116-030257 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-030171-030509 Now I think that  of my sisters, only the oldest is still Catholic. My younger sister is Evangelical, and I have decided that I do not have religion
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-031569-031857 That is, you're not going to Church or anything.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-031771-032053 No.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-032043-032104 No
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-032053-032149 Uh huh, no.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-032240-032810 I am going to the church, but I'm not with what they call a pious woman who is stuck at the church all the time. No.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-032709-032780 Hmmm. Not I, since I was married. I went to the university, and I left the university. I already decided that I wasn't going to return to the
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-033754-034082 I do not go to church, I am no interested in organized religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-035026-035202 You don't like it.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-035101-035631 I don't like it   I don't feel the necessity . I feel that God, I keep Him in my heart
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-035873-035949 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-035929-036186 I live my life well. I married my husband, he's Jewish and my son is Jewish too. We're going to bring him up Jewish.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-037069-037160 Uh huh.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-037125-037337 Because I do believe that one needs to grow up with a religion
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-037680-038094 Yes, I think that it's a very important base, especially for the children.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-037932-037993 Yes, definitely. I
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-038114-038573 One raises them and forgets that they leave and beome half wild.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-039214-039315 Hmm.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-039259-039623 They don't have like feelings. I mean, the don't create a relationship with feelings towards anything/
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-039890-040057 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-039946-040203 It's like they don't care about anything.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-040132-040218 Yes, that's why I agree that kids do well. And that's why they say
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-040980-041429 You say that you're a Christian and that what a miracle that they accepted you in his family, seeing that Jews almost always
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-041636-041772 Yes? Yes they are, really.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-041883-042090 They are, how do you say it
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-042030-042257 Yes. We were lucky.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-042090-042459 They have the same religion, so they try to marry only among themselves.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-042817-043100 It's true they are very strict
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-043594-043705 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-043660-043922 My husbands family have always been very understanding.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-044528-044962 I think I imagine that maybe
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-044846-045224 Did you get married by the Jewish or Catholics ?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-045148-045527 No, we had a religious, an Jewish ceremony
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-045497-045779 Oh. How nice.  Yes.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-045618-045986 Yes, and let's say then is what I'm saying, my son is going to be raised and I say it's important that he's raised with a religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-046334-046415 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-046375-046728 He is already an adult, he will decided what he wants to do.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-046501-046753 And what did they say.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-046753-047132 True, if I want to go, or if he wants. I don't know, stop being, be another thing, but I do believe that whatever religion it is, a child must be raised with the defined religion
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-048121-048428 My youngest girl, the one that is bigger they got baptized and are Catholic, but the youngest, though she was baptized in the catholic church, she also visits the church
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-049579-049771 The Evangelical church.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-049776-049922 Hm mm
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-049831-050094 Let's say that she doesn't have the opportunity to be bad.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-050856-051219 Their religion of theirs. And she likes going with them, and I never told her no. When they asked me if they could take her, I said yes.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-051608-051739 You know
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-051608-051905 I don't understand that, because my mom, when she says that, she goes to the church, she has to wear a skirt.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-052491-052798 Then, I tell her, but why is it bad to wear pants
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-052834-053212 I think that the Bible says, that, pants, are worn my men
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-053465-054020 Yes, but to me that was one of the
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-053535-053692 It is related to that.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-054045-054232 There are people who, when it comes to the Bible, take it as too strict. A little of what organized religion is.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-055357-055407 Those are the ones who become fanatic
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-055634-055806 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-055735-056210 They interpret word for word what is written.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-056149-056296 Words
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-056240-056553 The Iraqis, with their doctrine craziness, who kill people in the name of
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-057169-057451 The God they had, or what they believe.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-057416-057587 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-057527-057764 Sometimes there are people with their minds, distorted
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-057986-058122 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-058042-058470 Interpreting things that should be unifying. Because religion must unify, no matter which one. Do you Understand?, I don't think that only because two humans are from different religions they
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-059449-059651 Must kill each other, because of that belief
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-059994-060095 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-060095-060186 For me, as a non fan of anything. I don't become a fan of anything. I was raised in the catholic religion
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-061271-061614 I helped at church. I belonged to the Mary's Daughter Club, I helped a lot at church
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-062174-062513 It has always been, my faith, the catholic church. I took my children to church and I baptized them, because that's how I was raised
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-063234-063411 As growing up, if they want to go somewhere you should understand that You can't stop them to go some church.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-064148-064400 You can't believe in that, because the catholic church says it's different
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-064698-064849 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-064748-065036 Many evangelicals and Jehovah's witnesses try to come to your home and sell whatever they have to force things into your brain.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-066191-066565 Sometimes they knock and I thank them and say: I have your book, and if they insist I say, I'm catholic and don't
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-066827-067211 There exist so many kind of people. I understand them
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-067054-067286 They are no prudent
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-067216-067841 Their work is well, not their work, but they want to transform people into their religion, but they don't respect
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-068003-068114 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-068058-068164 Right? It might be me, but
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-068351-068846 I had lady that came looking
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-069401-069855 You're in sin, what do I know, but I've been a sinner since I was born my dear. so let the lord punish me when I get up ther, so
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-070486-071126 When they attempt to say such negative things, instead of saying that you can know the lord better.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-071333-071616 Everywhere, but that's about being a sinner. Yes, I keep sinning, and you're sinning right now talking like that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-000056-000597 Hello

20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-004014-004186 Okay, very good, your husband is also from
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-004838-005156 My husband isn't Peruvian.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-004930-005065 Peruvian American
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-005231-005494 Yes, my husband is American.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-005391-005686 Very good
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-005614-006081 What do you think about religion?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-006098-006454 I think that from the times of like medieval and that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-006989-007112 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-007014-007149 Religion stopped being spiritual during industrialization
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-008104-008190 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-008120-008317 It became something more political. Lately, it has ceased to be so political and keeps bringing up the ones that are.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-008996-009069 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-009104-009319 You can be very religious and spiritual
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-009620-009737 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-009639-009885 But not necessarily in favor of an institution and then maybe you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what is said by
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-010549-011040 Some certain institutions, like the Jewish one, the Catholic one, or the Muslim one. But then, maybe you can hear among the topics and mix a bit of the philosophies of all of them. Like
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-012006-012196 Use them to follow a good path of life
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-012633-012719 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-012645-012756 And what do you think?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-012811-012957 I am very religious, I belong to The Hare Krishna Religion. I don't know if you have heard of it.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-013586-013776 Ah, yes. I've never heard about it. I don't know very well what the Hare Krishna is about.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-013813-013946 Yes.  It's based on a Hindu Philosophy
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-014428-014569 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-014512-014925 So firstly, we believe that you are a part, or a portion, of God. And we also believe in reincarnation. We have rules and regulations. We're vegetarian, we don't eat meat, eggs, or fish.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-015606-015931 We don't drink alcohol.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-015909-016278 And why not, why don't you eat meat, why do you think that?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-016196-016463 Because for us, we believe that, every life animal deserves respect, we have to avoid violence.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-017397-017606 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-017482-018191 So that's why we don't eat meat and we don't intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-018209-018270 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-018229-018434 We don't drink coffee or tea.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-018479-018559 Yeah
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-018523-018683 We don't play around
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-018756-018977 No playing around games.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-018922-019038 No, and are you religious? are you from any religion?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-019161-019241 And no, I don't belong to any institution for the moment, I grew up catholic, but now I'm bigger I'm twenty one years old
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-020600-020950 Around eighteen I stopped following the institution because, I didn't have much interest in it
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-021879-022536 I felt in contact with my spirit.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-022389-022481 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-022567-023145 I didn't have to go the institution to get that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-024190-024737 To get an interest, and lets say practice life, but
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-024712-024803 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-024811-025155 I don't like the institutions
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-025147-025309 But you believe in God
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-025303-025561 Yes, definitively, but
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-025459-026092 That is nice when that happens!  Sometime you don't feel connected to a group of people.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-025942-026071 Exactly
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-026092-026770 The important thing is to have God in your heart and develop your relationship with God.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-026434-026563 Yes, precisely, knowing if it really is
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-027068-027247 In Utah I met my husband and now we are living in Idaho.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-027104-027362 A girl?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-027307-027383 Of course.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-027387-027528 I study chemical engineering
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-028635-028997 To corrupt religion
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-028887-028985 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-029010-029569 I think it's the opposite. People who start studying scientific things are normally very religious, because
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-030030-030559 When they start knowing themselves or about things, they can explain.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-030565-030670 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-030571-030915 More questions arrive and you understand that the world is not understandable, there are miracle things all over the place and time
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-031665-031948 I feel that each time, when people knows like scientist do, and those people understands that there must be a supreme chaos, and a divinity behind everything
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-032749-033123 Of course, a supreme being which controls everything.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-033153-033227 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-033177-033672 The, religion is, well, religions or the beliefs have a supreme being. It helps people being closer. In catastrophes and times of pain, then you always
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-034297-034593 Atheists are always desperate
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-035292-035695 They don't ask. They turn their faces, like that, from asking God to help them.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-035299-035379 Yes, that's it
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-035695-035914 It's not that, it's in their heart, right? You just feel that there really is a supreme being that many times doesn't.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-036436-037118 Exactly, you don't turn to religion only to ask for help, but also to thank
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-036575-036672 Of course.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-037143-037334 I think that many times, people become religious at certain times because they need help, but once they're ok, they forget.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-038077-038148 In our philosophy, there's  a verse that says, not, when you're suffering.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-038846-038932 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-038873-038978 One always asks god for help. and one should ask got to send more suffering because that way you remember him more.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-040161-040536 When you're ok you forget about your relationship with god
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-040518-040702 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-040561-041145 When you do fine, you're very happy.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-041034-041102 Yes, you don't remember?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-041157-041674 You think you are in control of everything that happens and that one does the work, right?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-041729-041815 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-042411-043254 God blesses and helps you in many circumstances.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-043217-043352 Yes, true.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-043395-043450 Do you have a notion about reincarnation? Have you heard or read about karma?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-044114-044600 If you had bad Karma you would reincarnate in`
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-044915-044976 All
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-045516-045750 To improve it, not just clean it, no that you have another opportunity to do your karma something good, more pure it's not something like that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-046240-046325 Yes. Okay, the karma law is the law of action and reaction. That, in response to his positive or negative activities, there is a reaction. It can be positive or negative.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-047520-047643 Oh. Okay.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-047538-047588 Why are there so many things that happen to good people
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-048278-048761 It's from the negative reactions of their past lives that they are suffering.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-049069-049229 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-049100-049929 Its not that people are not innocent , its just a reaction with free will.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-049990-050362 God doesn't force us to believe in him, doesn't force us to serve or do devotional service
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-050372-050459 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-050816-051052 We have our free will. And if we do negative activities, many times there is a reaction of the karma law. For that, nobody is free of the karma law. It's infallible.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-051670-051706 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-051999-052374 No.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-052057-052198 I see the hare krishna
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-052426-052680 Yes, in our religion.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-052684-053415 And what do you do? Do you gather with the Hare Krishna every week, or every day?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-053323-053848 I'm married now and live in the apartments by the temple.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-053858-054147 OK
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-053880-054122 The temple is here in Georgia, in Atlanta. But before I lived in the temple, I mean, I was like an intern there. I lived like I was doing service not to Krishna, no. To God.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-054399-054504 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-054746-055374 No there are many services we do, one is preaching, one is singing, and one is kitchen work
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-055611-055822 Does many different activities
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-055819-055930 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-055899-057006 The center of your life is god, and you offer him all your deeds and meals, and when you wake up in the morning you go to the alter and pray.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-057006-057265 So now I'm married and I have kids so I have to take care of them
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-057756-057946 Sure
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-057883-058633 I always go to the temple and we are devout. Many people come on Sundays or in big celebrations that we have during the year.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-058633-058785 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-058647-058758 Do you have something like a prophet, like Jesus Christ?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-059278-059719 We have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada Ace Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada. He is a devout of God. He brought this knowledge to the WEst.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-060516-060590 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-060562-060635 No, he's not. We don't really honor him.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-061143-061272 What's his name again?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-061156-061653 He respect Jesus Christ too
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-061530-061678 Yes, sure.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-061653-062509 Sure, he brought that knowledge to the West, about this ideas of Krishna, as we call it, we name it after the city
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-062446-062834 Ah. Okay.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-062680-062784 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-062877-063110 What is the name of that man, again?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-063063-063153 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-063165-063338 What's his name?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-063334-063679 Is called International Society for the Conscience of Krishna
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-063639-064100 Oh, okay. But what's the name of the man who brought you?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-064079-064155 His name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-064579-065022 Where does he come from?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-064866-064933 Yes, he was born in India.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-065157-065323 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-065253-065672 He is no longer on the planet. He already died and abandoned his body.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-065631-065809 It is very possible that he has reincarnated or won't reincarnate.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-066545-067082 He is considered a pure devoted to God, he returned to the spiritual world.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-067069-067321 So then he will no longer reincarnate
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-067116-067547 No, he will no longer reincarnate because he reached the goal of life in this world. This material world is where you develop your devotion to God.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-068059-068182 Yeah
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-068077-068431 From the spiritual world, you can't can't come back to this material world to experience the cycle of birth, sickness and death that all of living things go through.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-068465-068569 Yes, exactly
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-069116-069406 No, even the animals and humans being
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-069135-069282 Okay, of course
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-069440-069508 No
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-069559-069903 He has already passed that level and he no longer reincarnates
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-070087-070201 Yes.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-070186-070506 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-070201-070548 Yes, he passed that level. He is already a pure devotee.

20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-014743-015150 The cold in Cornell is brutal. The cold in Philadelphia can be endured right? The cold in Cornell is too much.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-015175-015319 That is how it is
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-015175-015494 But I don't know how you are going to know about that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-015475-015939 Yes wait a second that someone is knocking at the door and I have to open, one moment please
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-015695-015951 Of course
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-023473-023962 Hello.  I'm sorry.  About four minutes have passesd.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-023580-024125 Yes, it doesn't matter
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-024075-024463 They never open when I want them to open
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-024444-024939 Seems to me this program had several computer problems.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-025221-025590 Yes,
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-025503-025678 It happened to me two, or three times. I was in the middle of the conversation and suddenly it cuts out.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-026329-026780 I don't know then I sent them an email shudong.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-026805-027256 Yes.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-027093-027413 It told me, there were several people with that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-027701-027826 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-027732-028108 With that problem. Then another e-mail came form her saying that they had told her there were participants who don't speak Spanish very well.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-028622-028778 Yeah, those.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-028709-029148 And to hang up that when
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-028941-029317 Yes Shudong
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-029235-029329 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-029323-029686 Yes, Shudong tells you just hang up but that is embarrassing but I don't know.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-029843-030150 Only one lady from New York that doesn't speak much Spanish but I've talked to her twice
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-030673-030863 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-030958-031315 Her name is Erdestina, have you talked to her?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-031333-031542 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-031334-031453 Since I'm Josefina, Ernestina and I laugh
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-031771-031898 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-031791-032091 I tell Ernestina, Josefina and then
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-032215-032368 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-032260-032680 We laugh a little, and she tells me about her family.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-032806-033028 Is she American
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-033075-033275 I don't know because I think that one day I spoke to someone that lives in her house and they told me she was from an island
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-034033-034321 It is not Grenada but an island from
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-034546-034685 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-034597-034822 The Caribbean has a special language
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-035136-035333 And not necessarily Spanish
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-035348-035718 Yes, but regardless she understands, yes if one
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-035726-035904 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-035730-036118 If you explain it well she understands
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-036380-036634 No never, well what I have is in my account because I have two accounts one is hotmail and another in
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-037231-037542 In the university they hardly ever send me
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-037553-037678 No,
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-037574-037841 I like receiving unsolicited email, but I get too much of it in Hotmail.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-037985-038160 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-038139-038501 25messages and all trash but
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-038342-038693 Put like they arrive via
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-039047-039155 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-039144-039532 Josefina was rewarded with a free scholarship.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-039796-039904 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-039926-040221 And a trip, and cruises
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-040203-040393 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-040246-040615 I delete them because those are to know
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-040615-040761 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-040628-040897 If you answer not for
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-040825-041073 Yes the sad thing is that with because what they do people who send all those emails is that, they create programs
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-042038-042120 Hey go through the internet from website to website then when they find
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-042494-042601 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-042704-042939 A bit of everything, what do you listen to?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-042933-043058 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-042958-043263 They put it on a list and then
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-043108-043471 I tell you and how they find out so much about you, no?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-043434-043898 They also go to the news group and go to
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-043496-043647 Such weird people
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-043904-044273 To the all and then it is easy the hotmail directory
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-044838-045187 They look for names and then they create a huge list
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-045175-045394 Wow
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-045200-045523 And then with that list they make a message and send it to everyone in the list? the amount of work needed is so little right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-046177-046352 Mhm.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-046279-046507 If two or three people answer from the thousands, they already earned enough money for whatever
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-047035-047273 To cover the expenses right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-047225-047600 It is sad that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-047367-047486 It is
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-047619-048152 With two or three fools they already molested all of us right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-047899-048325 I installed a spam filter to get back in control.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-049307-049384 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-049346-049728 I asked for it. I did not buy it, but they installed it from
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-049739-049853 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-049816-050204 I believe that filters a little, but not always. It says junk appears ten or twelve a day, right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-050355-050539 If I read an article that looked interesting to me that Microsoft what wants to do is making software that does that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-051784-052139 That one time I sent a message to the computer that it has to make something I do not know that has to break a code or do some task so it is not
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-053028-053174 Very, very large
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-053129-053242 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-053180-053606 If one is sending e mail, write one e mail and I will send it, no-one will not even notice.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-053931-054037 So
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-053980-054088 When the computer does the task and break the code exactly in microsoft, it will send you a certificate to your email.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-055136-055542 The person took a little time to make that. If one is only sending two emails it does not matter when the email will arrive, and will know that it is not spam.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-056336-056448 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-056406-056736 One, the computer does not have the strength like this processor that can work a lot. Right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-057175-057263 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-057250-057517 Says this is to protect.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-058190-058501 Slow, and they wouldn't be able to send all the e-mails that are being sent nowadays.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-058496-058603 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-058520-058723 When someone receives an e mail that one knows is a spam, it can be thrown away.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-059179-059498 It needs to bring a file, attachment, or something like this.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-059765-060000 Yes. I don't know exactly.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-059862-060156 You want to open this e mail ?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-060057-060412 Know exactly what it is, but I think it's a good idea.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-060532-060613 I say they made it because when I send by yahoo, I have one mail division.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-061295-061358 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-061515-061609 In yahoo and sometimes when I`m going to send an e mail, it ask me one  to identify something that is decoded, needs to be decoded
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-062698-062787 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-062749-062974 I'm sick, so I'm not supposed to sit down, walk, or stand for long periods of time.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-062977-063149 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-063162-063256 I send messages like this.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-063263-063377 Yes.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-063300-063551 So then, put the pieces together, the letters how they go
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-063688-063809 Yeah
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-063764-064102 But sometimes is a P, R, J
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-064107-064203 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-064114-064427 Tea and a number and something like that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-064330-064501 And the numbers. Yes.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-064471-064891 It is like a puzzle.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-064590-064730 I had seen them
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-064991-065223 I don't know if that what is
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-065333-065536 Yes, I don't know.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-065361-065530 Protect it from
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-065549-065847 But I think the filters were not too efficient because each time that you put like you can say
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-066984-067422 What is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam right but many times then
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-067584-067697 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-067739-068088 Who believe in the SPAM, they know which ones are the phrases that, in general, activate the filters. Right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-068837-069050 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-068901-069193 Then they believe the message is the form that no
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-069576-069739 That not filter
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-069606-069911 That won't pick up the filter, yes then
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-069832-070070 And how is in the forums, had you thought in the forums like the Univision or Telemundo
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-070647-070888 Once in a while
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-070753-071210 When you write a word like stupid.  we don't permit that type of vocabulary
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-071669-071879 Interesting.
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-000005-000161 Hello, how are you?

20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-003917-003988 What do you think of unsolicited mail?
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-004382-004680 I think that unsolicited mail is a mess.
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-004604-004655 Yes
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-004685-005014 That I throw it in the trash

20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-006176-006379 It makes my nerves
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-006409-006737 I want to see who wrote the nine messages, five of which are new.
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-006763-006828 Yes
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-007096-007283 They went directly to the trash
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-007288-007354 The email is a scandal, the spam
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-007799-008330 No, the service I use for the mail

20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-012601-012955 I believe that most of of the services of the technical of mail have that now because is Is like an invasion because they try in any way to put
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-013961-014057 Words like it was a conversation,not only in English
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-014486-014603 Oh, no

20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-019344-019652 I want to buy a book, some cd, some ticket for a concert or for movie.
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-020087-020294 But that's it because I wanted, never because I have received a spam and I have opened it and have bought because I don't read it directly you know I eraseit.

20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-012207-012452 I work in the court. When I'm not in the court, I'm at the house.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-013109-013179 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-013138-013445 It's the best moment to turn on the radio. And hear something to calm you and to put you back
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-013462-013527 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-013808-014037 I don't have kids but I worked in a day care for several years
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-014889-014979 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-014952-015038 That was the best when wanted to.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-015131-015262 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-015317-015746 One class of eighteen kids of four years to calm down.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-015539-015842 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-015746-016176 Put some classical musi
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-016265-016890 Hmhm, we
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-016335-016603 And it seems to change, the entire feel of the room. Because, it affects the sound of the human animal, like they say
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-017394-017647 Well, we had a
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-017410-017490 So.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-017687-017919 My daughter started to sleep entirely during the nights two months ago.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-018398-018600 Okay.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-018554-018640 But when she was seven, eight years we would take her from our bed,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-019013-019129 Hmm.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-019099-019421 To her crib. And I couldn't, you know, I had much difficulty in putting her to sleep, and finally I found out that yes I would put music, with a sound machine,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-020258-020465 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-020354-020803 She sleeps well. And now we bought her an iPod
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-020768-021075 Okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-020984-021615 I have a month and a hundred or more CDs
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-021579-021715 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-021650-021857 Then, I can select whatever I want her to listen to. Normally, when we send her to sleep
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-022078-022285 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-022240-022653 We take what is called Songs of Cradle
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-022613-022739 Ya
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-022694-022850 I put some music on, and turned on the sound machine.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-023324-023440 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-023415-023884 We put her in her cradle and start reading books to her. As soon as she hears reading, she's asleep in five minutes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-024433-024821 She knows the routine
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-024549-024665 Sleeping yes, and for that reason was that we bought the iPod.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-025290-025411 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-025366-025588 Because even when we are in our car, she wants her songs and to have all those CDs in the car,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-026233-026433 It is better bringing the iPod
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-026586-026636 And then, she is, too. In some ways she isn't, but sometimes she acts like a baby.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-027302-027423 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-027368-027660 Then we bought the iPod with the money that she
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-027630-027776 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-027665-027857 She was, my high school sweet heart
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-027811-027897 Right
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-027877-028174 That she worked in, herself
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-028089-028447 So, more or less, it's like her vagrancy, with regards to what you did
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-028346-028502 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-028447-028599 That's a good idea.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-028563-028658 We did it, well part hers, and partly mine, because I have my music there too
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-029060-029171 It's not going to be her music only.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-029178-029263 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-029366-029659 It'snot like that
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-029510-029823 Probably ninety five percent hers.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-029803-029944 Oh. Wow.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-029863-030221 Because that's how we are in a place, because her little car too.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-030463-030559 See comments
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-030508-030740 It has an earphone
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-030685-030806 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-030766-031466 But with that, and when we bought it, I thought, who's gonna put a Walkman or something? and that's what I'm doing now.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-031430-031701 No, that's the best, it's the best because, I'm telling you the point of view of a person that was a teacher
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-032047-032364 Yes, me too.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-032147-032505 The parents cultivate the kids' love of music. It's so much like teaching them to read.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-033308-033588 It helps them with concentration, if one observes kids sometimes it, when they listen to piano music
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-034238-034375 With their little fingers as if they were playing piano. All of that helps,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-034593-034689 Hmm mm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-034797-034934 For the development. I forgot how to say development in Spanish.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-035026-035102 I understood, don't worry yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-035349-035572 The development of the child for e-, for yesterday, so you're working marvels. Because I always thought that. I say to my husband all the time. When we have kids,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-036721-036860 There are certain things, that you may think are a bit crazy.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-037068-037159 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-037271-037635 You know that I want to give birth in a bath with water, with music. And he goes, Aha. You are half-crazy.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-037729-038147 We are going to have a baby.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-037981-038228 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-038157-038258 God willing, in a week
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-038430-038742 Wow
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-038521-038601 And that's what we're doing. We're going to the maternity center that we have here, and that's what we're going to do.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-039055-039146 Yeah
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-039277-039373 The first one was a C-Section
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-039620-039736 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-039715-039877 No, and it wasn't because I wanted to. It was supposedly for an emergency.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-040129-040779 Oh, OK, oops, sorry, it's the dog. Shh, quiet
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-040194-040477 But I think that. Okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-040779-040936 I'm sorry.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-040900-041016 That's okay. So,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-041219-041429 Uh huh.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-041268-041863 We're going to do that. And with her, she doesn't watch any TV.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-041813-042090 That's best
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-041919-042025 You know, and often times when we go to church and they teach her with the little Elmo dolls
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-042398-042675 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-042549-042831 Or whatever, she just looks at me like what's that. People look at me like, how does she not know who Elmo is, and I say, well we don't watch TV.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-043332-043794 That's the best method to insure the success of the child.  That's the problem with my husband.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-044523-044705 Well I tell him, because his mom was a little strange because she taught him, she let him to, he was always right in front of the TV.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-045231-045337 Uh huh.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-045267-045393 My mom and dad never bought a TV, and I didn't have one until I was thirteen years old. He finds it strange
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-046366-046436 That I was always ahead in school. In the school system I was always ahead, I finished college early, he was waiting on me. Everything I've done, I've done it quickly,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-047490-047813 And easily, and I always tell him it was because I didn't have all the distractions. I didn't have a TV to take an hour or two
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-048589-048690 From my studies. You know, it was always focused. My mom and dad were poor, but yes, one of us wanted to play music, and my mom and dad would do what they could to take us to music lessons.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-050036-050278 If we were interested in animals, we'd go to a museum
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-050445-050556 Yea.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-050495-050657 On the weekends, there was always something educational. So you grow up little by little, I mean when you're a teenager,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-051473-051952 You grow up and you see the difference. And from your friendships you know about all that, that they know about that.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-051655-052008 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-051952-052276 And you feel weird, but when you become more mature, I look back and say thank you! I always tell my mom and dad, thank you so much.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-052966-053284 I can buy all the things I want, if I want an iPod I buy one. I have one
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-053319-053435 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-053354-053732 If I want a Playstation? We have one here, but mostly it's just there picking up dust!
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-053813-054115 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-053919-054196 I'm not interested and my husband says, if you are not sitting down to play with that thing, I won't play with it either. We never use it.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-054519-054610 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-054564-054731 It's just there. I also see the benefit of not wasting my youth away.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-055280-055406 Also, since we are having a baby, I was thinking that we shouldn't let her
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-055653-055734 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-055860-056278 Watch television, but I was looking for an educational show that I could let her watch but
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-056485-056858 There are many shows nowadays.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-056848-057181 Yes, but I, still I couldn't.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-056858-057045 There are not that many, channel 13 has two that have the approval of the school system.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-058109-058210 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-058139-058265 In New York
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-058215-058608 What happens is that I know won't have a problem to get her interested in it
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-059001-059107 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-059067-059218 And I'd rather- yes, I can try to- until she's around three or four years-old.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-059324-059586 Hmhm.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-059571-059959 That she continues with her love for books, and music, and all that, I much prefer, you know, that we continue with that. I don't know
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-060363-060645 No
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-060524-060857 When the baby arrives I feel that I'll have a little bit of time
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-061295-061860 The most I'll do, if I do it, will be half an hour a day, and it's going to be a program that I know that
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-061603-061673 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-061865-062057 You know it's educational.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-061986-062319 I don't know you, but I trust that you will do a wonderful job, because of the way I hear you talking.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-062687-063050 I saw it and said, yes, this is what I want to do!
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-063423-063484 I don't know, but
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-063584-063801 But
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-063731-064048 But, I know.  I am listening.  I realize that he us good.  You kow what you say is correct.  No, there is nothing
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-064588-064794 That I would do different, so to speak.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-064784-065379 The biggest problem we have is that we don't watch much tv
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-065324-065455 Hm mm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-065410-065843 If you come inside our house you'll think we watch a lot of TV because our have came with.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-066090-066226 Came with those 52 televisions.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-066373-066731 Okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-066579-066993 Last Christmas we bought a TiVO
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-066968-067119 Okay.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-067058-067295 Then, we recorded hose old movies and or programs that we are interested but
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-067386-067482 Hm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-067744-067971 We never see ABC, NBC
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-068092-068319 That's the best
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-068223-068621 It is the Discovery Channel
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-068480-068707 Yes, mhum.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-068652-069020 But because of that reason, I don't want her to see telivision, my husband is watching television.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-069337-069463 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-069342-069650 When he is in the house, she is awake. No, we don't turn it on.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-069831-070119 Okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-069973-070310 That was one of the difficulties we still have a bit, that he understands that I don't want that she watch television.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-070744-071031 But he does not understand, that if he is watching television, she is watching
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-071036-071142 Is giving her permission

20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-071319-071626 The problem I have is I don't watch television. I am always in the room.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-000030-000096 Hello.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-000090-000328 Hello.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-000257-000475 My name is Zula of Texas
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-000459-000697 My name is Manuel, I am from Chicago.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-000647-000788 Hello, Manuel.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-000768-000930 How are you?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-000839-000965 Good, and you?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-000965-001127 Good
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-001061-001243 You are a father again?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-001253-001369 Excuse me?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-001334-001546 You are a father again?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-001536-001723 I am a father again.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-001637-001981 There wasn't any problem.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-001981-002133 No, everything was good.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-002107-002234 Ah, how good.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-002208-002598 I was holding my baby in hand five minutes ago.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-002603-002714 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-002673-002830 Why did they take her to eat
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-002795-002916 And it is in the house or is it still in the hospital?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-003265-003720 Yes, in the house.  No, the next day after it was born, we left the hospital
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-003659-003826 How goo.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-003801-003978 Everything was good. No, we were only there after he was born. Twenty-four hours, and that was all.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-004453-004594 Now, he awakes every two hours.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-005428-005514 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-005489-005610 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-005716-005919 Every two hours we must feed him.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-005898-006035 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-005919-006212 Well they are nursing him.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-006490-006561 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-006561-006889 He doesn't need formula.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-007081-007203 WELL, NOT YOUR TURN TO AWAKE
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-007349-007425 It's okay. No. That. Nothing, one or two times he awakes but that is all only to be with them there
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-008325-008446 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-008643-008785 That's how it is
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-008931-009245 Speak with Jenny
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-009250-009346 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-009285-009513 I also spoke with your brother but, I forgot his name.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-009705-009841 Yes?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-009765-010008 Because, he began to do it. To study as well. Because Jenny stopped participating.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-010726-010948 How come you have told me nothing of it?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-010908-011256 That is what he told me both times we spoke.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-011792-012298 She spoke a little Spanish.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-012333-012495 Hurray.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-012490-013051 I sent a e mail to the person of the studio, and I asked what will happened
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-013501-013597 Yeah.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-013531-013693 And, he told me to hang up quick, it will end the call, because it will not charge that call.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-014274-014461 Okay.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-014299-014830 He sent an e mail to everybody in the world, saying you can speak with someone
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-015189-015411 Do not talk to that person.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-015396-015654 I also receive one e mail from them.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-015664-015730 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-015775-016377 Then, it looks like, your brother told me that Jenny read that message then decided not to participate anymore.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-016675-016943 Yes, I heard something about participating.   I did not say I was no longer participating.  It only told me that
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-017555-017732 That it was thinking it was for her.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-017716-017797 Ah
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-017787-017878 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-017797-018353 I told your brother to tell you I sent that e-mail and did not send it for her, it was spoken by that other lady that did not speak Spanish, little words that knew to say in Spanish
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-019192-019364 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-019192-019278 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-019420-019683 I think she speaks Spanish well.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-019637-019834 Yes, she speaks well
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-019748-019870 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-019981-020289 It is weird you get in the car with her, she drives a Van, a caravan
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-020582-020648 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-020679-020962 When I was in Nebraska with them I drove once and it was weird
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-021326-021376 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-021381-021791 I used it several days and took her cd case
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-021791-021846 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-021877-022165 Maybe she has music in Spanish.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-022144-022225 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-022165-022256 You are not going to believe it, but she had 60 or 70 CDs.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-022594-022665 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-022685-022786 All of them in Spanish and then I asked her Jenny why do you have music in spanish. Why don't you have music in english? And she said, no I like music in Spanish only I don't like music in english
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-023762-023893 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-023848-024025 Oh, I said, that's good.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-023984-024085 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-024247-024510 She knows everything, I don't know how long she has been practicing Spanish or speaking spanish. she speaks very well.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-025021-025071 How long has she been married to your brother? It sounds like your brothers children are grown up now.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-025814-026208 The thing is that she had her kid from before.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-026138-026446 Oh, she already had.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-026254-026694 They're about four years old.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-026668-026739 Right
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-026754-026871 Three or four years
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-026835-026962 Yeah.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-026886-027012 Yeah, she has children from her previous marriage
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-027371-027447 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-027447-027740 Oh, they have only one daughter
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-027664-027745 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-027765-027922 From my brother's
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-028003-028155 I don't remember what we had to talk about, but your brother was telling me that he has had problems living there in Nebraska.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-029120-029464 Since there aren't many hispanics, and he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no Hispanics, he's the only Hispanic
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-029823-029924 Yeah
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-029833-030338 And, I told him that if he had problems with people looking down on him, or talking to him, and he told me he hasn't, that he has only had problems once with
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-030692-031334 With the father of another of the kids that were competing in wrestling with his kids.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-031354-031668 Oh, yes, one of them is a wrestler.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-031764-031855 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-032168-032557 But, wherever you go you'll gonna find good and bad people.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-032532-032729 Of course, yeah, it always happens.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-032790-032850 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-032815-033108 Well, he said no. In addition, he said he had many problems and he also got many invitations to attend Christmas parties.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-033578-033871 I did notice that. I think that since this town doesn't have many Hispanics, in fact, there aren't any
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-034256-034326 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-034311-034650 In places where there are many Hispanics, people start to get along with bad people.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-034994-035165 Sure,
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-035085-035484 Americans start looking down on us
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-035352-035449 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-035484-035787 Hey think we are all the same
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-035711-035812 Sure.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-035802-036070 And since there are none here, they don't have
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-036045-036308 Prejudices against them, yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-036136-036515 They don't say this one is Mexican, so he's not going to do that.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-036439-036611 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-036530-036899 No, I believe they haven't met many Mexicans.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-036864-036940 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-036965-037385 And because of that, since there are no Mexicans there, they don't have problems.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-037359-037430 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-037465-037738 When Mexicans have a party, they finish at one or two in the morning and they play the music at a very high volume, like that.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-038183-038385 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-038183-038335 And over there, there isn't any of that. Until just now. In a bit more, Hispanics will start arriving
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-038891-039280 Yes, it's true. It happens.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-039113-039240 Yeah
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-039331-039508 What music do you listen to?

20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-040837-040938 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-041095-041540 And even though, here barely, sometimes, I can not find records of that, I search but since it is barely heard here, it is not heard much,
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-041721-041782 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-041893-042414 Sometimes when my brothers come, I bring music from there.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-042520-042919 And traditional music from Mexico, you don't like it?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-042940-043309 I like the nortena
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-043167-043243 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-043395-043556 Yes, like the traditional, like mariachi and all of that, not much. Banda too.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-043880-044052 What about regular music in Spanish?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-044375-044562 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-044840-045144 What, of any country, I don't know
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-045063-045280 I like to hear that?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-045265-045346 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-045305-045492 I like to listen to Colombian.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-045492-045588 Colombian.

20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-046771-046867 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-046817-046923 Not too loud
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-046918-047140 Okay.

20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-047807-047893 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-047888-048000 That music can relax me at times.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-048308-048389 It is good to listen to music in the car, more so if you are driving alone.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-049137-049243 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-049455-050148 I am not one of those people that constantly listen to music, I have friends that listen to music constantly and now that people have those Mp3
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-050628-050709 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-050679-051179 Where they can have eighty, one hundred, or two hundred songs constantly. They have those in their ears, listening to music.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-051583-051917 I do not like that much
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-051892-052251 Yes, not me, do not like, from time to time. Yes, like that, to relax or in the car, or if I go exercise, I also like to hear music.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-053347-053762 Yes, There's people that can't sleep. My brother lives in Nebraska.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-053757-053812 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-053807-054151 There was a time that he slept, and if there was no music he did not sleep.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-054111-054202 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-054278-054768 And I told him to turn off the radio already.  But insisted that you can't sleep without music and never sleeps at ease.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-055192-055304 Each one.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-055334-055794 Yes, I like to wake with music.  My alarm clock is a music player.  When it alarms in the morning, I rather that sound.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-056795-057037 Kills your heart.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-056931-057068 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-057048-057406 Is the music that we have here inside the music player. Then, it is good because it wakes you little by little.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-057760-057882 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-057816-057907 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-058170-058599 I don't know, dances or clubs? In Texas?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-058700-059074 When you arrive here in Houston, you will go out often to dance salsa.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-059246-059317 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-059337-059747 Yes, I encountered a group of people there where I go to school, that dance salsa and go out often. But, now no. Now I don't have time to go out anywhere.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-060399-060459 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-060510-060707 Became tired of going out because I had already gone to all those same places, and seen the same people
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-061582-061976 I want to dance, and if I could not dance, and almost could not dance, and the people stepped on you or strike you when they are circling. Then,I had already tired of that.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-062047-062107 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-063027-063376 Besides that, you have to pay a lot to get into those places.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-063462-063629 That's right.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-063492-063786 It is like ten, fifteen dollars to get into those places. So, not anymore. I now go out but I rather go to a quiet place.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-064665-064756 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-064756-065009 Where do you you sit and talk?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-064913-065297 We have a dance salon in here, Mexican groups come and play,
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-065272-065347 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-065347-065519 Northern music, and stuff like that.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-065499-065605 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-065575-065878 You won't believe that it costs around fifty dollars to get in.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-065812-066444 Why do they bring well-known groups?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-065974-066055 Yes,Still, some people are not lucky enough to get tickets, some don't get in.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-066717-066828 That's because you live in a very big city!
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-067344-067405 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-067410-067491 So,

20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-067839-067981 But you can't even walk in there!
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-068138-068360 Yes and no. That's the problem,
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-068401-068623 They are good groups from Mexico. Everybody want to see them.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-068977-069037 Of course
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-069073-069528 The ball has a capacity of 4000 people. I went once and didn't like it.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-070180-070336 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-070261-070473 I don't go out that much because I have too many problems

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-004210-004342 Puerto Rico
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-004301-004382 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-004392-004453 And How long have you been here?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-004397-004589 I have been living in Chicago for the past thirty years
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-004751-004928 Long time
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-004903-005029 Yes, a lot. And you?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-005029-005287 I have been living here for ten years, this year.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-005398-005545 Wow
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-005555-005838 Not so long, yet, but it seems like a lot. Right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-005807-005929 Isn't it cold there?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-005994-006323 It has started getting cold, but not as cold as Chicago
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-006313-006515 Chicago is very cold.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-006520-006596 That is right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-006525-006682 Especially the snow
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-006702-007026 Oh, I heard that is terrible.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-006990-007056 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-007051-007294 My brother-in-law lives in Chicago, too.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-007258-007445 In which part?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-007354-007415 Yeah. I don't know, because I didn't see where they lived, but he goes to the University of Chicago.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-007971-008087 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-008057-008208 I think they live near the University apartments.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-008486-008648 Oh, okay.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-008628-008754 So I don't know where
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-008689-008941 You know today's subject right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-008941-009073 The music
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-009073-009169 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-009098-009376 What Puerto Rico music do you like?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-009417-009513 I like very much Bachata music
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-009735-009912 What is Bachata?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-009821-009877 It's soft music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-010311-010387 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-010392-010529 When they sing that music, it's Alejandra and Alex. I have always taken CD's from the library.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-011418-011524 Yeah
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-011469-011646 I also like Reggae, I don't know if you listen to Reggaeton, which is trending now.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-012181-012409 Yes, I have heard something.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-012348-012500 Of Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Tego Calderâ€”n, Ivy Queen
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-012889-013081 So, living in Chicago, did you struggle to maintain the music you listened to back in Puerto Rico?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-013617-013769 No. Almost.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-013693-013784 Because a lot
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-013779-013900 Almost the same
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-013905-014138 Because it isn't. There is a lot of variety here in Chicago.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-014224-014390 Couching
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-014365-014608 You didn't miss that a lot?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-014532-014653 No, because back then,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-014679-014764 Oh, that's great!
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-014800-015058 Back in Puerto Rico I listened to the Boleros and Salsa, but I don't really like them because they aren't dance-able.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-015725-015831 I see.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-015882-015957 They're more romantic.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-016129-016210 I see.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-016165-016488 But we use the Merengue a lot.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-016513-016584 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-016574-016802 That's like: Olga Taâ€“on, Elvis Crespo
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-016877-017014 Oh, yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-016943-017226 Here in Chicago they do a lot of Puerto Rican parades
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-017418-017560 Oh, so great.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-017433-017570 They are invited. This year came Ivi Queen which is the the the the Babe of Reggeaton.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-018429-018611 Elvis came in 2004.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-018429-018520 What?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-018621-018712 Crespo.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-018712-018879 Really?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-018859-018960 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-018889-019112 Nobody comes to Idaho.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-019061-019172 No.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-019127-019304 No.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-019218-019455 In September we have a Boricua Party, Tego Calderon came. They always have many concerts in the parks.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-020330-020537 That is so awesome.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-020380-020527 They are free.  They have signs that say Long live Chicago.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-021199-021275 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-021235-021568 And they take lots of music from Colombia, from mexico, from all parts of Puerto, of, of the world.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-021851-022114 Then you don't feel as far from from where you come from
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-022225-022382 Aha
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-022301-022407 There is all that,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-022397-022513 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-022407-022660 There is nothing here in Idaho. Here, the only music is more like Mexican music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-023135-023262 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-023226-023454 I don't know what it's called.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-023636-023727 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-023686-024025 But it's music that I haven't heard over there in Chile either.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-023989-024111 No
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-024065-024146 In Chile you listen to music more like boleros.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-024778-024874 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-024828-024935 You miss it here because you don't hear much of that. And no one comes here either.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-025799-025839 True
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-025809-025946 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-025839-025961 I missed it so much that I'm now listening to satellite radio.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-026497-026593 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-026572-026840 And that's how I have been able to remember now many songs in spanish, because after like ten years, finally listening to songs that are playing now
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-027487-027654 That stuff like Reggaeton
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-027598-027720 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-027725-028079 I had no idea about that because it's been ten years since I have listened to music in spanish
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-028104-028316 Because now here in Chicago we have a station that's, nine hundred three point one FM.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-028867-029029 And it's music in Spanish
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-028913-029064 THAT PLAYS ALL DAY LONG
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-029236-029393 Oh sweet
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-029368-029727 Right, specially when you're driving in your car
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-029727-029802 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-029757-029929 You don't get bored put on the radio on high and the travels seem
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-030394-030510 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-030414-030535 You don't get bored or fall asleep in the car
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-030828-030985 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-030909-031031 Listening to music
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-031076-031496 Yes, it's good having music in Spanish because.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-031486-031551 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-031536-031829 Because in English, it's good, but it's not the same.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-031784-031900 No
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-031834-031951 It is not what we've been raised or anything like that.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-032011-032219 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-032158-032390 It really makes a difference if I'm happy with listening to music in Spanish once again
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-032795-032891 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-032886-033048 In my mood and all of that
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-033053-033406 It's like that music I don't know if you're listening to the music that has when they are one waits for another person
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-033775-033947 I got the phone to speak that music I don't like because it is classic
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-034655-034781 Looking forward to see
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-034781-034973 When you go on an elevator
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-034978-035120 Of course

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-035347-035428 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-035368-035600 It should be changed because it is not beautiful music.  Please, put on Merengue or Bachata, or music
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-035959-036141 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-036010-036055 Like Cumbias, Cumbias are beautiful
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-036404-036571 And more animated, right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-036545-036682 Aha
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-036616-036793 If you're waiting so long, at least you can dance?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-037026-037182 Is it that you go to sleep waiting.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-037460-037551 Yes

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-039341-039558 They already hung up on calls
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-039558-039659 Seriously?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-039644-039780 None

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-042283-042394 Once a day.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-042444-042495 Yes.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-042545-042692 I talked to my sister

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-043233-043395 And I speak with her. She is who in the recording for this show when you hear to the child saying what to do and all that stuff,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-044112-044173 Oh

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-044355-044562 Then when she did the recording she said to me that calling for, we could hear her and speak with her, That was the only time that I speak, because from there I don't speak more
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-045219-045341 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-045326-045411 This is my frist time talking with someone else.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-045457-045543 You are missing twenty three
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-045952-046139 Yes, I got my act together and that is why I called, because I was waiting for someone to call me. Nothing happened.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-046427-046503 Because the last time, they put it for politics.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-046786-046887 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-046802-047034 I called, and no one picked up the phone.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-047352-047570 It's scary. Is it not?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-047388-047454 But, you know, I receive calls each afternoon at 5 pm.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-048166-048288 Okay
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-048323-048545 That if I want to pick up the phone to talk, but I do not pick up the phone because I do not know what they are talking about.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-049081-049192 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-049122-049283 How is the music? This is the second time that I talk.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-049536-049622 Sure
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-049607-049738 I have talked with many people from Nebrasca, Philadelphia, Miami.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-050310-050456 I see
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-050416-050476 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-050466-050638 No, I like the music topic, it's easier. The other time it was about immigration. That is what I think.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-051048-051235 Yes, I spoke too.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-051280-051563 I do no like to talk about politics and migrations
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-051573-051639 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-051664-051796 I don't know what happened
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-051720-052155 I don't like politics but I talked about immigration, marriage and music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-052387-052463 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-052417-052695 About cell phones, I only have nine left to go.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-053074-053403 And after twenty-something calls, you don't have to call anymore. Right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-053347-053560 After twenty five calls, you wait two or three months, they then send you a cheque home
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-053868-054010 That's good.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-053979-054055 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-054065-054318 I'm going to start working
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-054338-054737 After five o'clock you can call anyone that appears on it
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-055016-055091 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-055031-055177 Call after 5pm in-order to get a hold of someone.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-055759-055870 The title of what they're talking about. The theme.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-056112-056213 Is everyday different?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-056436-056689 Last time, I talked about five times referencing marketing
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-057133-057295 Five consecutive days.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-057214-057315 I talked for about an hour with two music, three with marriage, once with cellphones, there are lots of themes.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-058155-058271 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-058180-058463 They didn't change, the themes have changed.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-058913-059009 Sure
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-059029-059272 But first you had to talk a lot about the topics.  Almost always they were the same topics so people can talk.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-060010-060090 Sure
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-060116-060257 Look then, ah
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-060141-060202 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-060288-060439 You. When you are driving, do you listen to music or not?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-060717-060773 I listen to music on and off for many years.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-061698-061799 Problems. Conversation programs
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-062042-062117 None

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-062173-062254 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-062289-062370 After a long time I get use to it and I forget to listen to music.  Then days pass by without listening to music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-063007-063113 Aha. Aha.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-063088-063235 I realize the music really changes your mood.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-063710-063765 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-063725-063887 Form for the rest of the day.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-063861-063957 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-063952-064215 Now I started listening music to have better mood.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-064412-064478 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-064483-064574 Because I don't know, it would be because of our Latin blood
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-064847-064938 Yeah.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-064898-065054 One always needs.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-065039-065191 Yes.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-065721-065914 Yes, because here I do not listen to much music like that of that style
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-066227-066308 Yeah
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-066293-066368 Right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-066424-066712 No, not merengue or salsa, not regueton, nothing? It's just regueton?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-067005-067167 No. I like everything now.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-067137-067238 Yeah,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-067172-067400 I am in Chile and I like salsa and Merengue.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-067642-067698 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-067895-068168 Now, the only thing I need to do is to learn it, that's all. But, I love it
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-068264-068673 No, but don't you watch them dancing on TV?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-068684-069037 No they do not have any Latino merengue or anything like that here.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-069255-069371 No
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-069346-069583 No, because there are very few Latinos here.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-069538-069659 Yeah
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-069624-069735 Most ones here are unique. They are Mexicans.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-069892-069978 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-069937-070038 But on TV, on the radio, there is nothing Spanish, nothing Latino.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-070407-070579 No movies either?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-070604-070761 On TV none.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-070751-070842 No?

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-071004-071256 We are in the middle of nowhere.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-071241-071459 Bless you! Imagine that.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-071494-071651 Yes, it's boring.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-071625-071787 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-071681-071939 Boring. When I went to California to visit, I was to-
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-000007-000536 Betsy, hello, how are you?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-000095-000932 One time yes, I am Tammy again, well and you, Oh my God
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-000660-001138 I'm seeing what you can tell me about social assistance or whatever, because I have no idea.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-001454-002247 No. Yes, here, I think that some things are good but others are not.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-002269-002651 Aha
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-002313-002966 Especially the one for older people they they don't give them enough money or or it is not because of the money but that they need medical help the pills are not completely covered
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-003701-003804 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-003796-004634 It is more difficult for them to take their pills because they have to think about  I have to pay  for the pills or I have to eat
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-004626-004979 Oh
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-004692-005346 Because they have to pay more and also there are people who abuse I know people who they are abusing
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-005529-005698 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-005941-006514 That other people really need
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-006462-006558 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-006624-007219 It is difficult as I have my wedge, my mother of my husband
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-007175-007623 Aha
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-007241-007740 She is on assistance. But they don't help much and she has to search for coupons
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-008541-008856 Should I buy a medication this month or next month?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-008856-009238 That's ugly
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-008944-009422 He cannot have all of them because if you don't take things as you are supposed to take.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-009414-009664 Np
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-009458-009877 You are scared because they will not help.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-009818-010318 His is the welfare or pension or
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-010112-010443 Is this from mja or welfare?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-010435-011258 That is it, I can imagine
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-010575-011155 Assistance that is given to them here isn't much, and it is hard to get, and you have to show that your need is real.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-011845-012543 If you do what it takes to get it you have to be working
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-012543-012660 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-012646-013461 They do not pay you well. They pay you twenty dollars or a little more
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-013020-013145 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-013483-014004 Or, I think it iss less than twenty dollars from what the limit that they will give you deoes not help
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-014085-014173 Yeah
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-014107-014563 It is twenty dollars over the limit that they have but really that is not a lot
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-014570-014665 Yeah
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-014599-014878 Prefer that you do not work
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-014900-015025 I see
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-014988-015569 So that they are able to help you, but the help that they give you is not enough for you to be able to survive.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-015547-016090 They don't pay you for all the medicine you need?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-015906-016406 They are giving you something? No, they can't help you.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-016281-016707 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-016421-017133 You can't survive without their help; although If you don't work enough they will not help. Also, if you work too much at once, they will not help.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-017375-017853 What they help you with is not enough there is many ways anyway
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-017507-018161 It is hard and some people work under the table
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-018602-018829 Yeah
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-018697-019079 Because they can not say that they are working because then they will not help them and they have children
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-019571-020298 When your children have there eighteen years they will no longer help
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-019931-020482 That is why I was seeing my son my child that crazy comes to my home and tells me, Hey mom so why do you not want apply to the government for them to give me lunches
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-020607-020746 None

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-026298-026768 Okay more expensive.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-026783-027569 If a person has four people in the house and it has been twenty and four thousand he cannot.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-027275-027686 It is not enough
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-027716-028399 Take care of your credit and save money
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-028700-029324 They don't spend it on things that they don't need
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-029008-029618 You recall now that I spoke with you yesterday
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-029603-030631 Yes, you already moved back

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-033671-033804 Yes and when he moved with the girlfriend he was not working
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-034450-035294 The people from work said that he can go to the school in the morning.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-035331-036044 And to work after that so they will help him so I tell him well if you move here, if you go to school I will not charge you for rent
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-035610-035772 That it is good
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-036117-036543 But if you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because I want him to finish school
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-036528-036895 Of course
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-036653-037740 When I am with him, I babble. He does not want to finish school, and things will be difficult for him.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-037432-037549 I would not send him to work at McDonald's forever
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-037843-038577 Mja, I know you will not help him if he needs it; because you are a man.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-040193-040957 I always give example of hard working people

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-041493-042249 He has the insurance in, Canada with him.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-042102-042447 They put laws like that is illegal in the state of Virginia.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-044761-045510 My brother and I were in high school there for a few months while my parents were working a job.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-045892-046685 From there because my parents were working they helped us because my brother was fifteen

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-046729-047258 I already had eighteen they did not help us for. for me, just for my brother but I got into high school and did not work until
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-048242-048638 I though that they would help you a little because they give you a card for medicine
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-049204-049343 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-049299-050093 He has to present it at the store where he will buy the medicine and and they will pay well that was the last time that I asked for assistance
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-050988-051547 But now I do not know how it will be. It should be more difficult
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-051591-052303 When my husband came from, he was in the air force.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-053691-054286 Sufficiently to be helped and for the time it took for him to find work so he took a month
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-054315-054484 How great
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-054337-054998 He found a job within a month but the next paychack it took us a month and we came out one time from there but when one goes to the store one of them that they give you are like fake papers
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-055799-055938 Really?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-055843-056350 When you go out shopping they give you a card
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-056335-056460 Oh
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-056416-056702 But the people give you mean looks
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-056731-057356 They look at you as if you were from another planet
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-056798-056937 They are giving you help and you can work. I could not work because where would I leave two children. I did not have anything to pay for someone to look my little ones.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-057965-058053 Mja that is true.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-058560-059037 I told my husband never again.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-060146-060543 Like
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-060455-060837 Because things didn't turn out well but it is very difficult
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-060947-061659 They have had the same thing happen.  They give you a dirty look.  It is just like that.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-061424-061894 People won't recall about that
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-061850-061975 None

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-064494-065199 They went because they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't want to do that
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-064817-064927 It was like a little paper that said that the government would help and the people knew
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-066044-066183 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-066154-066837 It's not money and they don't send you a check for your house or into your account

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-069848-070421 The government would do it to make you ashamed
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-070384-070949 They had to be sure that you didn't use alcohol,that looks bad so now with the card it is better

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-028200-028529 And that's good, you have times that is better to go out and see the family
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-028741-028852 Is difficult to go see your family and go on holidays and and more when you marry because you have to se your family and
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-029984-030272 Your wife's or husband's family
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-030090-030414 Oh, talking about, that is another issue.

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-032805-033174 Wherever you go, you are going to spend money.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-033164-033260 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-033189-033452 I don't tell you to visit family.

20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-035009-035236 Wherever I want to go, but yes I have been to Europe and I have been in Costa Rica and Guatemala I have been in Mexico but only in Mexico City.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-036222-036540 In Puerto Vallarta and Chiapas.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-036520-036702 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-036581-036748 I was in San Cristobal and Taxco when I was
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-037946-038203 Taxco
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-038173-038385 When I was in Mexico.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-038416-038593 On vacation?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-038416-038567 Yes I have a friend that loves to travel, but to stay long in other countries she just got back from being abroad two years in
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-039786-039917 In Taiwan. When I ran into her in Mexico, she was touring the whole country for six months.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-041095-041373 I ran into her in Chiapas, so we went to San Cristobal, Guajaca, and Taxco
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-042156-042303 I returned, she stayed.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-042293-042510 Yes, I have vacations.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-042303-042525 Ah, from Mexico City. She was studying
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-042712-042859 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-042717-042909 She was like two years old
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-044062-044219 Mm, how nice.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-044122-044421 Yes. Then, when I did ten trips with her, I hardly spent anything because we stayed at hostels, I don't remember what you call them.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-045614-045750 You have to sleep in a room with a lot of people but we didn't pay anything
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-046579-046827 Two dollars, or three dollars, a night.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-046817-046973 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-046903-047105 Almost everyone is a student and you have to share a room with people that you don't know.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-047514-047903 Since you know the people in area, there is much less danger here.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-048060-048222 No, yes, they are people that
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-048171-048318 These are
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-048222-048358 Who is doing the same as
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-048338-048616 People who are in the same
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-048358-048540 They come to travel like so, and they want to spend little money so they stay like so and then that was good but I also went to Europe and I stayed a month also in
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-049718-050047 Traveling to Europe but that ended up being expensive but my parents helped me because it was my present for graduating from the university so yes but after I was in Houston
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-050911-051164 I have only gone to Aruba which is in the north coast of Venezuela.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-051619-051770 Okay.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-051730-051806 Yes. and that is an island like Puerto Rico but I didn't like it, it is a famous tourist site in the Carribean but I didn't like it.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-052918-053171 Puerto Rico is a lot greener because Puerto Rico is an island. Aruba is deserted island and there is nothing.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-053964-054070 Absolutely nothing the only thing is that the beaches are beautiful but aside from the beaches there is nothing to see
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-054813-055081 It's deserted there?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-055132-055309 In Aruba
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-055263-055364 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-055349-055637 It's very dry, flat and rocky
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-056234-056426 Beaches are also rocky
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-056416-056522 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-056441-056653 Yes, the sand is white and the water is very clear. You can also see beyond the water, it is very clear blue
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-057336-057467 Notice.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-057341-057472 There is nothing else to see. Absolutely nothing else.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-057917-058205 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-057967-058190 I am lucky that all my family is in Puerto Rico except my sister, who lives in Florida.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-059206-059433 All the rest are in Puerto Rico but still, now, for example, I went to visit my sister in Florida and then in August
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-060192-060454 And then, I traveled to Puerto Rico to visit my family. And in December, I'm going to Canada to visit my boyfriend's family.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-060849-061021 I don't have any time or money left
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-061197-061420 That's right.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-061268-061405 I have made three trips. I have no money to go anywhere else. I think when I finish school, I'm going to take some.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-062421-062855 Time off on holidays. Before I start again, I'm going to work to
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-062780-063012 To rest.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-062926-063164 Yes, or to go to some place where I want to go. A different place, not just to visit family.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-063846-064099 That's fine, because once you start working, you don't know how your life is going to turn out.  Your whole life is going to change, right?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-064842-065024 Mhm. Yes, and usually when you start working, they don't let you take time off
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-065555-065661 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-065600-065716 I've heard of companies that tell you that you can't take time off during the first three months, you can't go on vacations, and some other companies say it's six months
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-066202-066368 You see.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-066278-066515 How's your baby doing?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-066687-066925 Very well, thank you.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-066818-067010 Getting bigger
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-067036-067319 He's getting bigger, he was born on a Wednesday and we took her to the pediatrician on Saturday.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-067713-067814 Aha. Aha. Aha.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-068062-068350 And she had gained about a pound.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-068320-068411 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-068441-068744 The doctor was telling us. I was there.we were talking to him for a while, he told us that it's very good that she gained weight because many children
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-069371-069725 After birth they tend to lose weight.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-069664-069750 All
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-069765-070058 And, this girl didn't lose, on the contrary, she gained weight.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-070149-070205 Right
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-070205-070357 She'll be two on November the 18th.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-070301-070392 Right.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-070422-070786 I hope she keeps like that, without having problems.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-070630-070721 Right, at first they grow so fast
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-071135-071297 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-071135-071251 When children turn two they start growing fast!
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-000000-000587 Hi, Alex.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-000075-000492 Betsy, yes you're talking to Alex again, how are you?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-000642-001113 Fine thanks, you?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-000799-001045 The subject of the trips
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-001496-001769 That's interesting.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-001715-001906 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-001865-002316 Better that politics
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-002316-002658 I had a lot of different opinions
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-002610-002986 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-002692-003177 Right. You want to start this time.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-003170-003498 If you had money, I would like to go to Hawaii for at least two months
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-004592-004735 I say
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-004722-004886 What for ?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-004858-005029 Because I never got there. The grandmother of my husband says that it's beautiful because she goes every now and then. I would like to go on a cruise.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-006218-006567 Good Night!
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-006403-006717 Yes, he is.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-006717-006970 Yes, a cruise would be fantastic.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-006888-007373 I never got to go on a cruise before
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-007674-008063 Right, I traveled one time to Spain
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-008050-008159 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-008097-008255 And to Jibrartal and I liked it very much but the southern part of Spain where the beaches are
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-008726-008931 Yeah.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-008856-009109 They were very pretty landscapes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-009088-009211 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-009164-009526 I didn't have the money to stay very long
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-009485-009587 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-009580-009956 It frustrated me.  Then I would win a prize and I would have money.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-010476-010694 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-010489-010927 When one has money, one must have time.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-010865-010981 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-010981-011296 I would love to travel to Spain and visit the
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-011466-011583 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-011733-012102 There are many castles and interesting things there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-012075-012191 Yes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-012123-012382 Many things of the of the of the old world, many Roman things ah it's interesting, it's it's to know history
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-013230-013380 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-013346-013687 One needs money; it's an expensive country, especially for traveling
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-013940-014050 Uh huh
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-014022-014323 Yes and no it's not very dangerous where I am Columbia is very dangerous
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-014460-014651 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-014583-014958 One does not have fun there, even though it is a beautiful country.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-014945-015054 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-014993-015321 One is always concerned about the security of the country.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-015375-015457 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-015403-015799 Spain is better
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-015608-015738 I would go to Israel if there wasn't so many wars.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-016291-016428 Dangerous
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-016325-016612 If there was no war.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-016626-016715 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-016674-016838 I would like to go there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-016817-017186 Also, Colombia is a fantastic country, if there weren't what
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-017173-017289 Ya
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-017200-017501 You have great scenery.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-017487-017617 I imagine so, yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-017610-018123 Yes. We have coast there, as well, but the problem is the war and the
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-017863-017993 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-018184-018485 The drug trafficking has totally damaged the country, and the image they have of me is horrible.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-018997-019079 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-019052-019127 You'd like to travel between the US or Canada?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-019831-020050 In Canada, I would like to go to Montreal.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-020405-020760 Yes, they have told me that it's nice but cold
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-020774-021088 Now where we live it's rain all winter, nothing more
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-021355-021457 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-021375-021874 Where we used to live before winter was a lot of snow and  super cold
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-021861-022011 Where do you live?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-021977-022189 Near Vacouver
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-022243-022421 There is no snow?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-022373-022496 No
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-022455-022585 Impossible
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-022558-022961 No, because we're near the sea.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-022660-022817 You're very far North. Does it ever snow?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-023104-023425 Well, sometimes there is, but the next day, it's gone.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-023432-023528 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-023453-023794 And it doesn't freeze
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-023726-024266 Because here in Los Angeles there's never snow, maybe just in the mountains
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-024218-024621 Yes. It falls here, too.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-024403-024498 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-024656-025045 I wouldn't know, maybe once every three months or something like that, it falls
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-025243-025407 But if it falls, it must fall because you're very far north, Betsy.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-025735-025858 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-025824-026043 Yes, you're near Alaska.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-026050-026343 It's not too far because, it's there next to the Pacific Ocean
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-027205-027464 Near Seattle, Washington
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-027444-027567 Yes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-027539-027751 Have you been to Seattle, Washington
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-027587-027669 Not really.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-027929-028182 I'd like to go there.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-028161-028305 Yea
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-028264-028708 Yes and also Washington, DC. Once I went to the capital
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-028585-028783 Mhm
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-028735-029077 I like history and everything that has to do with history, and Montreal, Canada has nice things like museums.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-029706-029958 Two years ago
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-030047-030307 They say that Canada's really pretty
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-030293-030820 Yeah, if you like the winter and the snow.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-030779-031154 There's not as much insecurity like there is here in the United States.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-031175-031687 I haven't seen anything too bad
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-031674-031886 Here in the United States it's bad
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-031886-032091 Yeah, just think
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-031927-032282 It's almost like Latin America now
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-032248-032378 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-032350-032726 They criticize immigration here a lot because there is a lot of bad immigration.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-033034-033143 I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-033239-033492 It has spoiled the country very much.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-033451-033580 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-033539-034038 Through the years, I have seen that this ocuntry has really declined, and now in the United States there is abig difference between the rich and the poor.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-034462-034585 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-034544-034899 I think in Canada there is more of a balance.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-035002-035138 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-035036-035569 There is not much difference between a rich and a poor person in Canada, Like there is in the United States.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-035548-035801 There is a lot of poor people here
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-035788-036095 There are more social programs over there.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-035856-035952 Yes that is true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-036157-036526 And there isn't that much people there, the problem here is that there is a lot of people
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-036512-036943 I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-036580-036997 Yes, the country has gone down unfortunately. Yes, there has been a lot
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-037277-037674 We already went to Florida two years-ago.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-037558-037783 Yes and it's dangerous.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-037763-037851 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-037824-038063 They can rob you, they can do something to you there is a lot of poverty as almost like a Latin country already I don't see much of a difference now
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-038747-038870 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-038842-039355 Latin countries are known for the difference between the rich and the poor.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-039328-039505 I see it is true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-039389-039676 The United States is becoming like that
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-039621-039799 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-039751-040195 Yes, but there are interesting things and one time I went to Texas and I liked the views
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-040264-040346 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-040571-040892 I have always liked the Colombian plains
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-040831-041002 Super hot
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-040968-041186 Super hot but very pretty
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-041070-041248 I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-041200-041624 The plains of Texas are similar, a little more developed
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-041952-042116 There is, I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-042027-042526 LOT OF BROILED MEAT WAS BOUGHT IN THOSE PLACES
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-042293-042553 I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-042553-042949 It is interesting I would like to know Texas more
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-042908-043025 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-043004-043441 Through the plains above all, I love the plains the flats the kowboys I like them
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-043838-044104 The horses
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-043927-044309 The barbecues
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-044234-044624 I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-044343-044583 I love barbecues. How do they say barbecues in Columbia?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-044774-044883 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-044835-045129 You find that a lot in Texas
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-045123-045416 That's great.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-045225-045799 I think is one of the most interesting parts of the United States and I would like to visit Seattle because of its cafes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-046305-046660 Really? I didn't know that
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-046387-046462 Yes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-046886-047275 Well my parents are going to El Salvador in November for two months.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-047419-047630 There are volcanoes over there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-047569-047788 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-047760-047911 Yes I remember and the scenery must be beautiful over there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-048020-048164 Yes there is but then again there's poor people and
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-048710-048895 There is security
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-048744-049127 No.  There are nto many jobs.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-048963-049038 Yes, that's the problem with all the Latin countries that have never been able to get ahead
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-049387-049660 Yes is true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-049653-049920 Yes, I hope they can do it one day.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-049886-050227 Yes someday
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-050063-050173 Yes, I've heard the scenery there is very pretty because there's a lot of volcanoes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-050323-050466 Yes there are.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-050986-051123 How are the mountains and the Salvardor beaches?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-051601-051703 There is one that is called libertad, and there is another that there is a lot of swimming pools and sea waves are very big
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-053501-053863 Big waves?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-053555-053945 Hi, there.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-053993-054416 Because there is pacific and also the Atlantic, if
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-054027-054150 I thought it was just in the Pacific
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-054498-054703 How many seas have? Only Pacific
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-054943-055127 Like here
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-055141-055209 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-055161-055462 Because Florida in the Atlantic.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-055469-055592 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-055558-055660 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-055626-056104 Because Colombia has the Atlantic and the Pacific, Colombia has two seas
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-056302-056412 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-056371-056624 It is a very nice country, I tell you of Colombia because beauty trumps many countries
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-056781-057102 I can imagine.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-056986-057341 The country is the worst but in beauty has much
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-057198-057403 OK
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-057362-057580 Just as it has many queen models
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-057560-057799 The queen models.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-058195-058503 There are many bad things
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-058435-058804 It's true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-058599-059063 Yes, there are many things, I did not deny it, you cannot deny the truth
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-059050-059173 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-059077-059391 There are bad things out of those situations
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-059378-059576 I can imagine
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-059412-059794 And not only that, there is insecurities and
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-059712-059835 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-059801-060123 When you do tourism, you do not want to go to a place where something bad could happen
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-060396-060697 Yes, it is true.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-060478-060580 You want to travel to a place where there is not much insecurities.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-061264-061373 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-061318-061619 One thing that will scare you
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-061599-061735 What is that?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-061715-062009 I was never mugged in Colombia.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-061988-062125 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-062091-062507 And I told you in Spain, I was once robbed in Spain
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-062480-062617 Really?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-062583-062870 Yes madam, must be
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-062699-062911 How weird
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-062897-063396 I got robbed to, at a subway train
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-063348-063464 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-063437-063703 They took my wallet
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-063676-063867 No
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-063806-064168 And they stole a hundred dollars
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-064182-064462 And that was in Spain.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-064271-064708 In spain
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-064517-064660 In Spain, not Colombia
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-064817-065220 Colombia it's so famous for those things
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-065173-065384 I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-065234-065630 Nothing was stole from me because that was one of the reasons that I always take good precautions
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-065774-065911 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-065897-066239 And in Spain, when you are taking precautions.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-066218-066389 That's true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-066690-066792 Yes, and you know something there was a terrorist attack in there too
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-067489-067633 In Spain?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-067571-067920 Some trains were blown-up, they set up bombs due to Arab terroism
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-068302-068706 In Spain, really?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-068350-068528 Many people in Spain die at train stations.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-069095-069437 Oh, I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-069143-069813 I used to be in those places where the attacks took place, a few years ago.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-069744-069997 And that happened recently?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-070004-070182 About a year ago
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-070161-070236 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-070264-070503 Yes, if something bad is going to happen to you
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-070633-070783 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-070920-071214 It will happen no matter where you are
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-071207-071569 That's true, I see, mhm.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-000010-000187 Goodnight
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-000208-000578 Good evening, where are you from?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-000567-000782 I am from Colorado, USA.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-000776-001017 From Colorado. And originally?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-001017-001163 From Puerto Rico
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-001157-001708 I am in Idaho and I am from Chile.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-001698-002003 From Chile? How great! How long have you been there?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-002014-002432 I have been in United States for the past ten years
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-002282-002362 Ten years. And how do you like it? Do you miss your homeland a lot?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-003037-003530 Yes, a lot. It is like Colorado. Colorado has a lot of snow.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-003514-003991 And does it change often? this season changes of
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-003819-003905 Of course.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-004007-004269 Did you go from cold to hot or from hot to cold?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-004232-004494 Of course, Puerto Rico is not like that. Right?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-004312-004387 Today Puerto Rico is the same weather every year, but there your, to rainy moment and it's very sunny moments throughout the year like,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-005598-005828 July can be very sunny and May very rainy.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-006112-006321 But no snow
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-006283-006476 Oh, never. No.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-006423-006707 How long have you been there?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-006669-007012 I have been here for twenty years
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-007012-007130 A lot. since we talk about travelling, have you travelled to Puerto Rico?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-007660-007975 Since my parents died in 1993, I haven't traveled to Puerto Rico. I've been to Mexico and other places though.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-008961-009521 And I have gone to other plaes in the United States, including Florida, which is a
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-008962-009048 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-009521-009710 One of my favorite places.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-009712-010082 Have you always lived in Colorado? Have you traveled?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-010312-010821 And vacations to other states. Here, there is a lot to see. I don't know if you've had the opportunity to see other places here in the United States.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-011303-011485 But there are many very beautiful places
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-011335-011850 Just Utah, and, I went to Washington.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-012728-013001 Washington state  is very beautiful there
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-012750-012910 To Washington, of course, but not to the East of course, some day I hope to be able to, no.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-013462-013687 How did you come to stay in Idaho?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-013671-013821 To study
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-013826-013933 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-013837-014142 We came here after I graduated from high school, to attend University here.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-014282-014362 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-014560-015091 Wow, then I'll call you cause I thought you were calling me.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-015096-015219 How great.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-015117-015251 We have only gone back to Chile once five years ago.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-015744-015804 And
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-015776-016382 We hope to go back now, you know, this coming year perhaps.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-016451-016875 And it's very hard to travel from here to there, because of things like passports and other things like that.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-017153-017775 Oh, not so much. But it's more expensive than Idaho. I think that if we were in Florida, or California... Colorado is by the North, right?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-017967-018096 Sure it is in the center and we are down below
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-018562-018669 Then down below, but around the center
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-019125-019821 Yes,it's centrally located for flights ,from here they travel to south America.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-019569-019682 Then it is easier to fly
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-020083-020593 Yes for example if I said that I would spend some vacations in Cancun
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-020566-020651 Right
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-020641-021133 Went there for three days with around three hundred fifty dollars
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-021101-021396 Really.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-021133-021623 It includes hotel and flight
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-021562-022017 That's why we don't go anywhere. Anything that costs more than three hundred dollars is very expensive
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-022976-023512 You should probably go to the State of Washington or a more centrally located place.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-024048-024605 And have you traveled outside America, like to Europe or something like that, or you have not had the chance
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-024525-024883 No, IÂ´d love to go to Europe.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-025371-025505 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-025387-025982 They have been to Europe and told me Paris and Spain are so beautiful.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-025960-026266 What country would you live to travel to if you could?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-026266-026683 One of my favourite countries is Australia.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-026683-026860 And, in Australia
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-026780-027362 Yes and Australia would be fascinating for me because very exciting there and also New Zealand. But I would also like to visit Italy, Spain, France; but I think Australia is still number one.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-027750-027851 I think it would be Italy.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-028650-028982 Yes, Italy is beautiful
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-028746-029121 Yes, I think Italy. But Australia is huge, there is so much to do there.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-029164-029351 I have worked for a company where the president of the company was Australian, and he was the CEO of the company, so there we made great friendship.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-030916-031430 He would always invite me to go there, but I have a daughter of five years, I am a divorced father
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-031435-031623 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-031451-031660 And have decided custody.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-031682-031800 Of course.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-031687-031816 So,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-031842-032008 You will stay
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-031848-032158 I would never abandon or leave her.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-032030-032121 Yes, at least five or more years.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-032389-032785 When she forget has a father and starts to think in boyfriends
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-032951-033337 She doesn't want anything to do with you, for a short time
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-033187-033267 I am crazy for her and she is Crazy for me
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-033739-033980 Of course, right now is difficult.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-033792-034103 We have a great time.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-033991-034585 We have small children, too, and that makes it very complicated to travel somewhere
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-034457-034580 I want to go to Puerto Rico next year, her mom is Mexican so she knows her Puerto Rican
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-035113-035183 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-035373-035973 Then I want her to meet that and she's crazy for going there and meeting her grandma. Grandma comes here every year and they do great with each other. There's great chemistry
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-036423-036953 You better know her age if you are going to take her there.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-036873-037205 She
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-037221-037317 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-037285-037714 Travelled more than me in the last three years because she goes to mexico, with her mother, at least two times a year
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-038008-038373 Look, she's constantly
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-038325-038919 She's well used to travelling, she's really calm, the first time we travelled to Wichita
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-039433-039499 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-039471-039995 We went on one of those Greyhound and it was an awful experience, because she was very little still, and when she went on the truck.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-040007-040076 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-040266-040649 She shaved her legs, put on pants and dresses,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-040628-040790 I can imag
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-040708-041041 She had a very bad nightmare, and people there was really uncomfortable
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-041491-041544 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-041551-041790 And it was awful that travel, but
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-041700-042010 How old was she?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-041983-042182 She was asleep, but when she totally woke up she panicked
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-042107-042375 She didn't understand yet
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-042182-042344 I promised her that I was never going to take her in one of those buses there, we call them buses.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-042932-043033 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-042949-043140 The next time we went on a plane, a little plane and, we had a great time and she was very happy. And, not to mention it was only,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-044143-044565 One hour of travel, compared to thirteen when we took the bus
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-044485-044807 That is so.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-044651-044748 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-044807-045548 No, but it's great that people like traveling because, that way she is going to want to travel, because there are people who really do not like traveling and cannot believe that
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-044807-044919 It was horrible
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-045567-045776 Who don't like to travel
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-045723-046076 I would love to see the whole plane if I could.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-046060-046154 Of course.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-046151-046553 I would love to travel
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-047025-047496 People who have children have to be responsible.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-047421-047582 Yes. Exactly.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-047550-047785 Put your feet on the ground for a while
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-047753-047983 Yes exactly. If you have the opportunity to go other places, come to, Colorado; because it's very beautiful.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-048583-048803 I have heard it's really slow.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-048766-049028 You come here. It is beautiful

But you go here in the mountains, and you go to places that are fabulous, the beauty as is you were in a paradise.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-050989-051267 How long have you lived in, Colorado?

20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-053314-053410 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-053357-053892 We were married like ten years and went our seperate way
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-053908-054241 Oh, and she was American or where was she from?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-053946-054053 She was half Puerto Rican and half Swiss.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-054439-054648 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-054546-054825 She was studying, she took the classes as independent studies so while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling in Mexico.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-054819-054932 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-054910-055575 We got along well, ended fine and realized we had different goals.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-055483-055719 One changes a lot
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-055698-055933 Change a lot, yes.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-055751-055858 In those years.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-055976-056416 My daughters mother. It was a super short marriage.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-055998-056126 Sure.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-056437-056571 It didn't even last two years.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-056448-056533 She is from Mexico.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-056887-057101 She is from Oaxaca Mexico.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-057128-057257 Yeah
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-057144-057541 But we have a good father relation with the girl we work very well in fact today we went to her Kindergarden School
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-058092-058178 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-058146-058526 The teacher gave a good report on the girl
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-059196-059432 She goes with my cousin's husband and wears her long skirt.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-059421-059817 How rare is it to be rich?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-059491-059587 She is hungry to learn
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-060819-060991 Now where does she live?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-060975-061280 My ex husband
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-061253-061425 Yeah, with the girl.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-061333-061955 She is my sister
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-061928-062137 You can see her often
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-062110-062426 I see her three times a week every week.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-062453-062619 Look how father.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-062823-063016 We shared together with her.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-063032-063219 Look how good
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-063187-063321 That is good
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-063241-063867 If you are from Puerto Rico it does not cost you to come in and out of United States
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-063792-063985 Absolutely
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-063969-064226 I have never understood what is United States stand with Puerto Rico, because it is not a state it is a separate Country
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-064955-065244 It was invaded by Americans in 1898
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-065523-065662 Yeah
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-065528-065812 They took away from the Spanish from there they established American governors and from there they dominated until they started to gover-have Puerto Rican governors,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-066594-066905 Like in Nineteen fifty four they have Puerto Ricans citizenship.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-067237-067419 It has not been that long
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-067258-067548 But Puerto Rico, not that long, for example, when my parents were born were not citizens but I have been a citizen my entire life.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-068105-068175 Sure
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-068110-068292 From then forward they started free commerce which is a free association with United States but without being a state.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-069262-069514 Over there they vote on the primary for the president from here but they do not vote in the president elections.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-070055-070575 Then in some way it is Independent, in some way has lots.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-070082-070183 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-070591-071089 Union with United States would be very difficult because Puerto Rico would beecame a totally independent Country
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-071378-071491 Independent.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-071491-071844 They would have to approve first but they have never approved
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-000085-000358 Good evening Mildred of Connecticut

20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-005946-006223 It's like a merger of jazz with funk
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-006205-006575 Rock and all that.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-006289-006412 A break. Ah.

20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-010898-011466 Lately I think that is being forgotten, nowadays, music is mainstream, like Hip-Hop, now everyone is making the same music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-012179-012381 In the United States, and Mexico, they are copying it, it's become like a global gender.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-013061-013314 I don't like it but it is impressive that everybody is listening to hip-hop.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-014038-014204 In the music, I think it's like Reggae ton, it's becoming popular
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-014550-014665 Aha
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-014619-014962 Mexican music uses lots of hip-hop, and there are many rock bands that use hip-hop.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-015751-016060 I think that it is helping bring people together, even if they ae from many diffrent nations. Mexican people like salsa, some others that are.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-016660-016741 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-016726-017057 Different countries like salsa too, merengue, bachata and when you go to dances, well
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-017062-017239 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-017361-017620 There
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-017378-017673 Yes, I do enjoy dancing to merengue and salsa music, too.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-017620-017882 Are people from different countries dancing?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-017860-018112 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-017882-018375 I like it, I like Mexican music because it has a good rhythm, I like Ranchera music, I love it
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-018396-018482 Yes, Rancheras
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-018828-019081 I like them a lot.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-018830-018942 It is interesting to get to know music from other countries. I like them but sometimes I don't know the tunes.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-020228-020512 Have you ever listened to Arab or Turkish music?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-020520-020593 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-020711-020845 Interestingly, it's good too.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-020857-021218 Yes, very beautiful, and the chinese music also
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-020949-021037 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-021218-021725 Yes, especially o if someone knew how to interpret, well it would be more beautiful because they always present like a history when they do presentations, of them with the women that are moving their hands
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-022289-022496 Yes, and those fans
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-022312-022414 Yes.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-022671-022974 They use it in order to tell a story.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-022950-023357 They tell something with music, the music has no lyrics so they are painting an image.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-024112-024648 Having lyrics creates a musical scenery or story, like the Mexican music, The Corridos.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-025146-025617 They are very well known because they tell stories of different people and things that have happened, but they are very singular stories that are very good sometimes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-026423-026666 We are brought to old times, with the natives doing their
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-026967-027091 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-027274-027992 Their dances and everything, and the slaves were the first that used music in order to complain, in order to be able to say
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-028275-028398 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-028411-028916 They were treated evilly. They were expressing all of their
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-028553-028746 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-028916-029059 They're discontent.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-029057-029223 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-029191-029410 I believe that music will always continue for centuries
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-029833-029978 Clearly
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-029860-030420 Even though its different it will always unite the people because wherever you go, you hear reggaeton and already you know who it was, and sometimes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-030433-030535 Yes, already.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-030983-031333 I don't know if you remember that Japanese band; The Band of Light.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-031489-031607 I see
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-031703-031929 That they began to play salsa
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-031730-031880 No
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-032019-032254 Yes. They were Japanese and spent a lot of time here. I didn't know that they would last, but they played a lot in New York. They did not have discos when they originally played.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-033396-033600 The same salsa discos that they did in Japanese music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-034033-034242 Japanese
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-034374-034834 Or they would be safe. So that if a Japanese person came here, to America, they would say, well, he is dancing.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-034387-034548 No I've never heard them
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-034834-035128 They can say it although they don't understand
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-035019-035282 I see
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-035128-035264 I already think that it's pretty and relaxing music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-035282-035456 Yes me too
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-035860-036141 One of its uses is to relax.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-035868-035961 It's very relaxing for distractions.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-036244-036307 I have discos while going out in Puerto Rico
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-037087-037301 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-037134-037425 Its one to relax to
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-037355-037435 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-037425-037627 When you want to be quiet at home, you can light those scented candles and relax. That helps a lot.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-037997-038095 Yes, such as pure ambient sounds, or sounds that are
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-038567-038649 OK and you need music, you need music because if we had music people would be
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-039522-039727 Even a little more aggressive
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-039717-039985 It is that music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-039727-039982 Because music calms you down.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-040012-040553 Music can be very important.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-041254-041458 There is a singer whose music is called Afro bit, his name is Cela Kuti and he for the civil war of Nigeria
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-042514-042835 He was very important because him with all his music, he made revolutionary movements, I mean people didn't see him as a musician but rather as a political leader.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-043722-043801 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-043732-044005 Through the music he moved people. When he released new albums
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-044051-044123 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-044312-044679 The military was infuriated. And sometimes, he had the entire community practicing with him, all of whom had the same political philosophy.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-045573-046061 And all of them lived together in communities and when he released an album called Zombie that critizied the army, because they were like a puppet of the government that was
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-046786-047010 Killing people of their own race.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-047062-047145 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-047073-047555 He said everything in his song and the military heard it and
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-047405-047912 Yes, almost always, how do you say it? They extradite him from the country, they vote them
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-047903-048556 Yes, they threw him away, they jailed him and beat him and burned his whole house and all the
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-048640-048924 Yes, because they called it protest music. True.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-048932-049296 Exactly. The music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-049039-049714 In Puerto Rico they had topo, and who else sang that kind of protest music? Juan Manuel sang protest songs and sometimes made concerts.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-050083-050175 Yes of course
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-050579-050979 Like they sang the truth about villages
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-050641-050753 Yes that it
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-050979-051433 Against the government, and all that, they are
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-051305-051621 People that make a riot out of everything, and the government doesn't like that.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-051433-051936 They try to make people not go to those kinds of things.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-051873-052050 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-052136-052481 But its interesting because they make history.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-052141-052232 Yes of course, it gets involved in history as well, music will always reflect what other people are living in the moment, and what they think.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-053196-053292 I think that same thing
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-053491-053639 Yeah, that's good
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-053603-054067 They need music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-053939-054069 Yeah. Always.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-054067-054848 They tell love stories, disgraces, people problem.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-054846-054942 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-054848-054994 Daily life has many uses.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-055007-055125 Yes, everything. I think it's necessary that we need air to live.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-056353-056429 I love music that when I put it on, I clean the house faster.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-056866-056962 If you don't play music, you don't play an intrusment
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-057567-058237 No. I mean, I've always liked the piano, and my daughters like piano classes. I never had the opportunity of my mom paying for piano classes for me.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-058283-058372 Yeah
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-058596-059085 I like playing the guitar and the violin.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-059099-059207 The violin
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-059219-059570 The violin is an instrument that I don't know so much about, but it has precise music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-059710-060024 Not that much, I had a friend at school, that knew how to play the violin really good.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-060567-060747 Yeah the violin is good, you know what I like as well, accordion music, I live it as well.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-060830-061017 Like you said Mexican music uses a lot of accordions
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-061446-061526 In Puerto rico people we call it 'gicaro' of land, when they go out for Christmas
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-062335-062416 Yeah
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-063048-063251 You don't play an instrument.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-063326-063498 And I play the guitar, bass, and I try playing the piano, but its too hard, I cant
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-064366-064494 So I just left it there
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-064386-064680 My boyfriend used to play bass, but he's older now
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-064805-064891 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-065038-065156 But
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-065046-065137 Yeah
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-065156-065419 He played with bands and groups. He played the bass.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-065592-065812 I think it's always good to play music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-065812-065898 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-065844-066037 Also that serves on to let it off one's chest when I want to get distracted or something since I take my bass and I play a little
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-066696-066926 I see it relaxes you
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-066707-066980 It distracts me if it relaxes me.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-067082-067194 I see that is good
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-067205-067328 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-067221-067301 That is good. Here we have a lot.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-067730-067840 None

20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-068085-068404 There's a DJ and music around the whole house!
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-068394-068566 Okay
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-068491-068972 And, all the time on the internet recording records.  And,
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-068903-068962 Yes

20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-069262-069342 None

20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-071212-071260 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-071244-071475 Now he did not have so much work; he is with other jobs but he also records.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-000015-000211 Good evening. I'm Joe.

20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-002743-003080 I think your voice sounds familiar.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-003015-003432 Yes, I think so. You have your family, your husband, your children
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-003342-003609 Yes, you have a little girl right?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-003573-003780 Yes, a five-year-old girl.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-003750-004041 Yes, I remember. How is your daughter?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-004031-004223 Good, growing, becoming very pretty, and sweet
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-004530-004892 You and the boyt need to be careful.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-004847-005018 Right so, really that small she tells me that when, asks me that when she can have a boyfriend. I say, allot of time will pass until that can happen
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-005843-006186 Twenty five years
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-006075-006231 Yes, more or less. Could be
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-006367-006478 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-006392-006634 What, speaking of tonight's topic
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-006518-006609 Yes, how's there, how is where do you live ? It's a big city, in the city, or live outside?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-007097-007167 Right. Denver is a city. Pretty big, but then, nos-
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-007429-007494 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-007505-007726 I live in Aurora, that is neaby Denver
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-007716-007781 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-007726-008154 It's a pretty big city too, but it doesn't have tall buildings like Denver.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-008370-008607 And a little more quiet.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-008546-008854 I wouldn't say that it is quieter. I would say
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-008708-008823 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-008854-009130 The reason being, it is a mixture of all.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-009090-009206 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-009156-009488 Good people, bad ones, every ethnic group, you have, high crimes around too, and you seem to live a little fear
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-010117-010213 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-010132-010389 I live in an apartment. , I found some nasty situations around here
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-010827-010942 Yes?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-010852-011114 Including gun shots and the like.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-011149-011300 What kind of place would you like living in?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-011854-011949 If I could go, I would go to a calmer place, a small village, rather than a city.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-012458-012558 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-012619-012961 I am tired of the city. I drive here every day and the traffic in Denver is horrible.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-013409-013525 Yeah
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-013424-013696 Too many cars, and where my girl goes, school, it takes me a long time, and I'm sometimes waiting for about an hour and half just driving, before going to work.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-014738-014859 Wow
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-014823-015327 When you arrive to work you are stressed.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-015312-015493 A little more relaxted.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-015447-015629 With a big headache, yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-015593-016021 That's a big difference because it's calm here.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-015996-016087 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-016026-016263 Really calm
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-016132-016263 What? Is it a village?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-016283-016721 In general Idaho is mainly land, I would say.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-016947-017093 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-016963-017255 I man the biggest city boyce
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-017239-017385 Yes, over there
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-017285-017667 It is a small and relaxed city.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-017476-017546 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-017697-018176 I consider Idaho like a big town.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-018654-018744 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-018689-018931 Because it's not a city and there are no big buildings
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-019545-019630 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-019620-020068 So there is, it's like what is here, it's a big town. But
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-020114-020275 How is the crime, and things like that?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-020385-020904 Here people live, leave the doors open, the cars unlocked,
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-020743-020884 How cool.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-020934-021035 And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-020954-021171 That doesn't happen here in Aurora
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-021100-021508 Of course.  It is very peaceful.  No dad.  the daily news only told of someone who had lost something.  No.  Nothing happens if
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-022434-022691 If something did happen it would be the news of the
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-022550-022827 They're not about crimes, nor any of that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-022741-023119 Of the month
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-022932-023244 Wow, what most delicious thing.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-023124-023325 Sometimes too quiet
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-023300-023587 Well I'm going over there then, to be your neighbors.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-023531-024020 Yes, it's super peaceful. And people, a lot of people live in the countryside. So they live it's super peaceful.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-024367-024593 It's all the opposite of Denver
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-024377-024488 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-024598-024785 And Aurora.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-024684-025074 As I tell you, it is too quiet. There is not much to do, I mean here the people who live here they like things outdoors, like
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-025424-025464 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-025464-025706 Camping, and fishing, and going to the mountains to ski, and
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-025852-026078 People in Colorado too. we like going to the mountains a lot, camping
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-026516-026657 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-026632-026884 Well there are people everywhere, and
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-026879-027015 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-026904-027352 These people who have come from these places, they have brought many bad habits too.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-027362-027493 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-027387-027609 Things happen that make you live in fear.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-028031-028142 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-028046-028323 With my daughter I am always in fear, because there is a lot of talk on the news of what happens a crime in Aurora
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-028802-028942 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-028837-029275 That they stole this, that they ran over a kid, and the driver of the car is on the flight.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-029622-029667 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-029652-029793 Things like that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-029703-029904 Like city then
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-029929-030045 Sorry?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-029954-030010 When I used to live in Chile, I lived in Santiago for a while, it's the capital.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-030432-030523 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-030498-030825 And sure, it's different to live in a city. I mean, you can't leave your doors open. You can't trust no one, usually. And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-031444-031812 The cars, you can't leave your car, the Cs.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-031625-031736 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-031812-032149 They break the car windows to steal them.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-032134-032255 Everything
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-032169-032300 The CDs, and
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-032315-032511 That doesn't happen to everyone
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-032335-032652 I never leave anything flashy in the car.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-032672-032758 It's quite safe in here. For me, it's too quiet for me, but, it's okay because I have kids now so it's a good place to raise kids
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-033447-033568 I dream of a place like that. The only problem is
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-033609-033744 That's why
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-033926-034233 I have a divorced father. I have a daughter.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-034187-034283 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-034238-034389 My ex-wife and I share custody
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-034741-034988 You have to be close to
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-034917-035577 Yes, I would never leave my girl behind. I want to stay near her until she's grown.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-035360-035441 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-035592-035823 And one day she'll get married and forget about me! I hope not, but I know that's what happens most of the time.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-036332-036498 It happens a lot
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-036347-036483 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-036508-037067 But nothing, I would like to live in a more quiet place. My brother lives in Kansas
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-037062-037182 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-037092-037333 And it is also very quiet there.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-037308-037515 No
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-037354-037721 They have festivals. People are more quiet.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-037721-037892 A little tired, yes. But, God willing, in two or three weeks, when I have the baby, I am going to feel better.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-037877-038325 This area has many beautiful things to see.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-038315-038426 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-038335-038672 There are cities in Colorado that are growing since there are more people moving.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-039322-039432 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-039367-039654 That also has its problems
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-039619-039795 Yes, and that is what I miss. Because here there is a lot to do. Besides the things you do outdoors, there is no opera here, there is not, places to
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-040615-040968 The mall is very small, there are no places to visit or or ballet or concerts and things like that. Those things are not around here.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-041612-042186 City that are in Utah
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-042156-042276 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-042211-042760 And if you like to do things like that, go to concert or go to see you know an opera, theatre, or a show
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-043288-043666 You have to drive three hours to see the university and some tiny shows.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-044441-044718 You miss that from the city, no, that
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-044446-044557 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-044748-045005 That you can find that type of fun stuff, but at the same time, there is
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-045060-045171 Here you have the opposite.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-045322-045508 When we lived in Utah it was tranquil
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-045795-045880 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-045840-046233 In the city you have all that you want
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-046223-046308 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-046243-046389 And it's quiet
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-046354-046474 You have lots of relaxing parts. And it has lots of family attractions.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-047068-047164 Right
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-047098-047360 I work in a high-tech company area
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-048181-048256 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-048256-048835 You have an amphitheater too one block from my work, and sometimes we hear the concerts while working
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-049092-049172 Right
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-049097-049238 From the building
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-049208-049701 I would like to live near things like that, that have activities and stuff
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-049645-050033 Yes and no, here you don't miss that, the activities. The only thing is, particularly in the city I live, you have lots of crimes. I would like
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-050743-051130 You have parts of border areas that are fairly quiet.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-051468-051750 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-051548-051845 With good neighbors. Even though there are a lot of people, they care for each other pretty well. And like you say, they leave their cars open without fear of robbery, and other things like that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-052535-052630 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-052580-053018 In this, it is a mixture of good and bad.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-052998-053109 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-053053-053285 Understand, and the bad ones are the ones who like to take advantage.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-053426-053557 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-053501-053899 You live well in fear, and, calm
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-053894-054030 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-053984-054307 But traffic is horrible, let me tell you.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-054221-054543 I don't really miss
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-054307-054392 It is it is really horrible. Because sometimes taxi drivers and on winter days it is still worse. Because when there start to be all these accidents and you cannot move on the highway
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-055167-055369 Snow and ice and all that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-055454-055550 It is terrible.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-055595-056018 That is not at all strange
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-055958-056350 Someday it would be a dream to live somewhere quite.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-056531-056758 She lives very close too
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-056989-057427 I like in Aurora, Colorady and she lives about three miles from me which is close.

20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-057513-057674 In my old home, now my ex-wife's, they came in through the
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-058439-058661 Because the house has three levels
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-058651-058781 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-058691-059239 And the basement, its like isn't an basement. What did it stay up the windows
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-059265-059401 OK
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-059290-059587 They went through the back and stole a lot of things from the basement.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-060050-060387 Weren't they in the house?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-060317-060568 No, she had been gone with some coworker. I went to the house and inspected, and gave her my recomendations that she will have to lock this and that because
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-061197-061505 It doesn't let it exposed to the thiefs right
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-061484-061585 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-061555-061746 Where she is parking is not a very good place. They have get in her car about three times.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-062642-062828 That makes me angry.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-062687-063286 They have broken her window, taken her cds and stereo three times
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-063307-063498 That makes me angry
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-063357-063513 That's the bad thing of live in the city.you have any kind of atracctions
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-064031-064218 Sure. You have to.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-064087-064228 Disadvantages
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-064233-064399 You have to be careful
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-064409-064530 I missed
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-064434-064832 Sure, here you relax, and that's the problem, because there are somebody who comes from other place that take advantage of the circunstances. The people trust too much
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-065325-065486 Exactly
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-065461-065708 They relax.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-065723-065833 You have
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-065728-065838 And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-065838-065944 Sorry, continue
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-065939-066246 For example, when that happened, the news here was that this man came and killed his family, and he took away two kids.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-066936-067172 I remember that
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-067147-067635 Yes, because precisely, they are living here in the field and the children, you never know that somebody like that can come over here
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-067817-067917 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-067983-068088 And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-067998-068295 Yes, crime could happen anywhere
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-068229-068345 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-068345-068546 It is sad.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-068461-068838 You have to always be careful.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-068708-069080 Don't be so trusting with certain people, strangers specially
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-069246-069427 Sure.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-069332-069719 I always teach my daughter to not trust strangers and be very careful
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-070041-070434 When you have kids, then you start to worry.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-070585-070671 You start to teach them; they do't have to knock here or there.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-071129-071516 When you have kids, you  can take care of yourself
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-071481-071567 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-071516-071667 When you daughters, not any more
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-000000-000414 Hello, good afternoon.

20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-001025-001121 Hello?

20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-001863-002055 Good and you?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-002030-002343 How is everything going? How are classes?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-002262-002621 Well, good. Studying here a little bit, and they called me and I say, well, why not? Why not rest a little bit, right?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-003000-003131 Good.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-003111-003414 How are you? And How are your classes?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-003338-003439 Everything's going good, with this, I just got done with all the exams and well you see that I'm in that week where at least, you can can't really do anything.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-004277-004444 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-004388-004888 I'd say I haven't gotten used to the weather outside yet. It gets me down.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-004898-005020 Oh, no.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-005033-005148 I swear, in the morning I turn the window and get angry. Ay, not again.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-005520-005934 No, but, where are you from? or where do you live?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-005964-006156 I'm in the high-rises, yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-006156-006434 Before coming here?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-006292-006381 Yes, where?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-006530-006828 Before coming here to study?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-006893-007459 I lived, before coming here, I lived in Singapore for 2 years. And before that it was Ciudad de Mexico, all my life.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-007494-007595 Then that's it.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-007924-008035 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-008015-008358 It's very hot. It's hotter here.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-008141-008525 Yes. I'm getting used to the tropics.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-008363-008656 It's very hot in Singapore, right?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-008651-008981 It's tropical, nothing else
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-008984-009146 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-009008-009209 Yes. I came and it was today. What's going on?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-009343-009616 Then here, it's cold and
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-009813-009914 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-009823-009898 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-009914-010418 And in the air, it rains for a week. I don't understand how they can survive during this time.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-009929-010090 No. There's cold, and there's no sunlight. After the summer, it feels nice. But a week like that, a little cold
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-011202-011530 I like that but it is only the beginning right?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-011994-012121 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-012211-012563 That is what I don't like, but
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-012292-012479 Yes. If you can stand the cold until December, until Christmas is gone, after that it
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-013257-013525 When you return Christmas is over and it's not cold
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-013570-013651 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-013762-013909 The cold is worse when you return for Christmas because that is when it hits.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-014222-014333 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-014339-014658 Yes, please.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-014454-014621 Yes, I know my brother studies at Cornell which is farther north; about six hours from Philadelphia, but is
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-015461-015624 Much further north.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-015585-015712 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-015624-015838 Classes don't start until the 28th of January because it is so cold.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-016292-016535 Really?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-016472-016871 Yes, he says that it is so cold that it is better to spend more days in May than to spend the days in January, right? The students, because...
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-017484-017732 Wow.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-017710-017886 Fifteen years? Wow.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-018439-018606 It can not be
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-018560-018732 And my brother.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-018626-019121 And I was thinking about going there. Good that I didn't go, I swear that I wouldn't survive.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-019242-019496 My brother was lucky enough to get a town house
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-020045-020181 Yeah
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-020049-020384 They had a big house! There is a little living room and kitchen when you go in and there are rooms upstairs.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-020932-021149 It was pretty big. But the problem is, they were some of the university's new dormitories.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-021500-021686 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-021529-021701 They had built it in the university's outskirts so it was pretty far from the university.  And his classes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-022414-022813 Were engineering classes that were held at the other side of the university?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-022737-022924 Poor guy.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-022868-022984 There's a bus system there.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-023925-024205 Public transportation there, why don't you use it? No, I don't want to pay the fifty dollars
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-024525-024797 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-024540-024891 He spent the whole semester walking.  During winter, in twenty degree weather, he walked forty minutes to get to class.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-025879-026120 Ouch my brother
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-025898-026111 Poor guy
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-026120-026396 No, it's
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-026277-026752 He brought it upon himself
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-026396-026541 He's just cheap, right? He didn't want to pay the fifty dollars, so I said, that's ridiculous.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-027226-027497 No, because the bus only stops four times every hour. So, he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-027919-028080 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-028039-028252 I mean, my brother, I don't know
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-028141-028515 What grade is your brother in?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-028252-028382 Now he is in the eighth grade
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-028702-028868 Okay.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-028848-029015 Yes, but
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-028974-029085 That's fine.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-029030-029277 And what do you think about the crime wave here in Philadelphia?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-029353-029580 About what, the crime wave?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-029489-029671 Oh.  The crime wave, yes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-029595-029888 I have not heard much about it here in Philly
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-030373-030520 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-030414-030671 But I think that I have always been lucky because I have been walking at night alone on forty first and going to the store
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-031358-031651 THE FRUIT SHOPS ON FOURTY EIGHT I GO THERE AND NOTHING HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-031939-032277 You walk to forty eighth?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-032141-032338 Yes, additionally by myself, as happy as ever with my life, besides I don't even think about it, not even paying attention, I don't walk around in fear or anything like that
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-032893-032989 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-032909-033045 And nothing has ever happened to me I have no reason to, be scared of anything, to the contrary,once I get there they are all super friendly.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-033675-033869 I don't know but I think that
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-033681-033808 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-033904-034101 I think I'm lucky because it's the same in Mexico. In other words, all my friends in Mexico have a story about being robbed, kidnapped or something that they have had done to them
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-034823-035242 And nothing has ever happened to me. I am always alone at late hours of the night in bad areas, so all those things they say you shouldn't do
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-035843-035974 Uhmm, uhmm.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-035850-036298 I've done all of them at the same time and nothing has happened to me.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-036116-036555 The
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-036383-036686 I remember what I have done and I say to myself, how did I dare to do that?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-037151-037444 What was I thinking? I was a very irresponsible teenager, but nothing happened to me.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-037924-038025 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-037974-038489 So, I don't know, I don't feel insecure, I have lots of reasons, but you do? Have you met Philly
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-038883-039242 Good, I don't, to me
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-038893-039095 What's it like
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-039256-039556 It's the same old story, right? Nothing has happened to me either, I think I live in
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-040107-040514 Here, close to the university, I live in Walnut between the thirty eight and the thirty nine
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-040752-040939 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-040788-041212 It's not that far away and there are lots of police here,in general, I haven't met anyone that has gone through that, so I really think that
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-042121-042227 I read it in the paper, so it does happen.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-042358-042535 Yes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-042512-042643 I think that is strange; because, around here there are so many cameras.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-043262-043444 Yes, we do too.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-043390-043766 Lights, and cops have some phones and bikes. It's unbelievable
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-044257-044454 They spend lots of money towards that, but they're generally keeping us safe.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-044858-045136 Yes, they have lots of them.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-044868-045191 The people from the neighborhood for example, criminals right? They have to be careful with the security in this area.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-045918-046181 I don't know if it is very safe for the people that do crimes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-047104-047284 Before security was so strict on the quad, you could pass a card there to someone else.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-048202-048444 And then they would go get him, whats his name? the system, to see if one was actually a student from there, or not.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-049080-049289 They didn't make an illegal copy of it, right? But now,
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-049540-049626 OK
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-049625-049998 People could of gone in and out but they now have security systems.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-050498-050751 You can't do anything at all, right? so in general, they don't worry about someone in the university.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-051121-051242 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-051246-051406 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-051272-051580 Yes, in general in Philadelphia, there are a few zones where I wouldn't go.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-051969-052171 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-052005-052414 I don't like it at night in the center city, there are a few places where I don't like walking, too.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-052671-052808 No
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-052696-052823 I don't know the city that well or the people.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-053237-053338 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-053242-053535 In Mexico, I would see someone and then cross the street.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-053787-053914 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-053803-054111 Here it's like I'm scared about something or someone.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-054323-054429 Yes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-054393-054590 No
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-054429-054780 Philadelphia has lots of neighborhoods that are dangerous because
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-054671-054904 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-054780-055006 They have secure neighborhoods right? One from the university is secure, but
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-055792-056075 One goes towards north Philly, south Philly, and west Philly.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-056833-057063 So it really gets dangerous, so, it does for example, if one wants to go out at night, they won't go to north philly, so it's not that,
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-057909-058035 Important right?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-057984-058141 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-058035-058179 For us
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-058181-058338 Yes me too.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-058303-058439 Why yes, if one goes out, one goes to philadelphia, but that's an old city, so they have cops and everything.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-059276-059409 So
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-059318-059560 Why don't you know anyone in Philadelphia that knows history about robberies
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-059909-060292 In general, the majority of students stay at the university, not in the old city
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-060772-061045 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-060829-060909 I think people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-061843-061953 In general, every week there is
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-062772-063089 There was a robbery so one naturally thinks, what's happening? Right? But
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-063621-063878 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-063831-063991 In reality its im, one thinks that they will get jumped, or will jump two hundred students, but there's twenty thousand students, so the probability is that,
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-064943-065098 That happens to one
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-065101-065338 Yes, also
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-065141-065464 Of course it exists, right? but is not that tall
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-065469-065742 Is it that much more expensive
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-066101-066308 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-066121-066500 The forty-third, that is how it always happens they can not do that either
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-066747-066878 Yes but that also seems to me, that it is better to live like that in something like university high-rises because especially if one returns over there in the night and
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-067939-068106 It is very calm
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-067958-068287 It is nice to have
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-068111-068303 Do not worry about anything
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-068287-068529 To walk for a long time, the people that live like that in Baltimore but the squares in Baltimore are huge, they must over there
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-068863-069010 Yes. There is no light.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-069055-069193 Yes, huge.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-069328-069479 No light
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-069479-069611 There is no light.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-069484-069621 On the blocks
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-069621-069742 There is no ligh. But, in the high-rises it is better, more calm ones do not have to buy all of the furniture
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-070489-070641 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-070555-070989 If something happens, one calls the university and they take care of them
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-070979-071171 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-071030-071338 I've heard alot of stories of people having problems with people they will with.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-000020-000106 Hi

20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-003174-003422 I am in the linguistics program

20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-003740-004321 No, I know people who wear it and I know the LCD and what they do.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-004038-004124 Okay.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-004347-004554 No.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-004377-004635 How final are they making this program, or what is
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-004822-005125 The LDC, what they do is collect many types of linguistic data, whether that's text, something spoken, and then it can be used for many things, for example,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-005671-005711 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-006065-006434 Programs that can understand voice, need training, they don't need
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-006485-006571 Oh, okay.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-006808-006985 A supreme being
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-006975-007091 Ok
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-007026-007501 For this it's possible and,for studies of for example how people pronounce the letter this way, up to the dialog, how it develops,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-007809-007875 Wow.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-008294-008957 The LCD collects data for many languages.  And then the people
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-008785-008845 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-008957-009396 Can do more things, more applications, more studies, or more theories?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-009351-009502 More specialized.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-009462-009614 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-009573-009836 Wow, okay. And where do you live here in Philadelphia? In what neighborhood?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-010144-010210 I live in West Philly, but not very west let's say I live at forty-third and Spruce.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-010771-010877 That is not not that west
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-011287-011454 No, too much west
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-011398-011459 Yes I live in campus
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-011514-011615 And
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-011838-012005 I live high
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-012025-012106 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-012030-012131 In the skyscrapers
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-012146-012227 Mhm, mhm.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-012257-012621 And how do you feel the air, living so high at 43rd?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-012641-013101 I like it a lot.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-012879-012950 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-013162-013718 They said good, that Philadelphia was a little dangerous and such
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-013703-013764 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-013718-014092 Caution with West Philly. In the guide that spread on campus, they say it's dangerous to go out at night.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-014497-014577 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-014507-014835 Right. This is my second year now.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-014820-014946 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-014896-015315 And I truly didn't see nothing and no bad things happened to me. I don't feel unsafe either, in general. Could be that.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-015725-016276 Watch few things, the news around here they scare you a bit
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-016144-016281 Yes, that
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-016331-016463 I would say nothing bad happened to me and I feel safe. I don't feel like I am in danger.  I know people that do feel like that and they get scared about West Philly.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-017934-018020 Yes, the black people, there are lots of them that gets intimidated by the black people here
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-018459-018717 Right
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-018788-018894 Eh to me
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-018793-019233 That is his problem, I don't know
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-019061-019177 But how a lot of people associate West Philly.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-020138-020279 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-020219-020507 The neighborhood of the black, and then, unsafe
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-020315-020451 Yes, that too
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-020562-020638 But
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-020648-020896 Tell me
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-020658-020759 I am not frightened because I have a friend who is near forty-five.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-021442-021533 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-021497-021750 I walk over there frequently and at night too.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-022033-022175 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-022064-022276 When I cross the park at night, I sometime meet a lot of people.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-022675-022751 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-022741-023302 There are lots of people there at night. At two in the morning they are rumbling
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-023469-023737 They never threatened me. They never asked me for a cigarette.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-023984-024171 Mhm
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-024136-024374 No, I don't see them provoking
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-024581-025122 No. Its true that things happen, I know a girl that was attacked. No?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-025112-025233 OK
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-025162-025268 Those things happen in every city
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-025344-025420 Yes, all
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-025647-025941 And in every city there are crimes and I don't know, but I do believe that here
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-026239-026330 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-026401-026729 They give it attention, and it's still repeated a lot. It shows up on TV, and in the newspapers. It ends up creating a collective state.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-026946-027058 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-027305-027467 Of psychosis,no?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-027467-028018 It's exaggerated
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-027760-027877 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-028043-028569 It's more the idealization, like of what they are thinking
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-028938-029039 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-028983-029221 They are making it more serious than it truly is.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-029267-029332 And, West Philly, has some not very nice areas, but it also has some very nice areas and is very nice to stroll around.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-030156-030298 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-030192-030818 People that live in Center City, that never used to happen, no? to come to have a stroll around here
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-030758-030874 That? No.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-030839-031203 In my opinion, I think it's a nice neighborhood.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-031233-031481 Yes. I don't dislike it at all
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-031470-031526 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-031531-031880 I mean, Its not particularly pretty, or nothing, but, I mean, its like you say, there's some good places to walk a bit, and
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-032673-032805 Well, living here as  university student. Everyone lives here. So at the same time you don't want to be too far away from here because then you get disconnected from the university place and students.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-033447-033583 Yeah
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-034119-034281 Me too, I think.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-034185-034251 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-034286-034463 The people live in universities are comfort
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-034529-034594 I went traveling to sesenta street
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-035201-035312 Yeah
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-035216-035433 I wanted too see what was going on
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-035459-035590 What did you find
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-035615-035964 I found a neighborhood, a poor neighborhood, it was ugly, a few houses were old, or not taken care off
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-036783-036844 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-036798-037016 It was poor in a few places.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-037005-037081 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-037091-037228 There wasn't anything disgusting, or something scary
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-037824-037895 Yeah
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-038047-038138 The income for those kinds of neighborhoods, less than others.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-038466-038653 They make a lot less, yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-038628-038749 There aren't any white people on the streets.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-039154-039240 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-039224-039780 Those are the things that have surprised me the most about Philadelphia, no? The division so large that there is still.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-039679-039983 Impressing displacement
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-039952-040200 Yes,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-040064-040129 It is impressing to see that, the more you go to the west, Black people are more than Whites.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-040938-041044 When I take the bus, I get on it in front of my house. Sometimes, when I get on the bus, I see weird things.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-042000-042065 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-042338-042793 The advan- Go eastbound, and then westbound, these are opposite, and one thing.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-042697-043031 Yes it is true I have used the bus only once.  But I do recall getting on and then noticing
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-043354-043718 There is only black people from eas- to the west
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-043652-043905 Yes it's strange.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-044026-044219 I have always said, the result of this action causes the black people here to have a lower income.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-045149-045406 Sure, sure. It is a relationship with social class. No more than something racial, it is clear, yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-045695-045760 Yes, more than anything. It is simply just that. But,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-046251-046433 Where you from Mexico?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-046417-046655 From, Mexico City.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-046736-046832 They say that it is dangerous, no? Or, that it is.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-047029-047812 Yes, over there, over there is a lot more serious
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-047565-047641 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-047843-048485 There continues to be a lot of segregation of social classes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-048293-048358 OK
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-048515-048758 I have like an appearance that is much more European. I am blond, with white skin and light eyes,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-049091-049208 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-049481-050067 And if I walk through some neighborhood, there in Mexico, kind of unsafe,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-050052-050163 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-050133-050441 Sure, I am going out with a purse.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-050426-050567 Wow
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-050481-050673 It is not going to take long to catch me.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-050835-050967 Aha
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-051073-051472 And, they might even kidnap me. It is more probable that they kidnap me.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-051422-051755 That I had also heard, kidnappings like that
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-051720-052099 Who they kidnap? It is no longer because you are from a family
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-052402-052544 OK
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-052458-052741 They take him in a care, and they call it express kidnapping.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-053095-053181 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-053504-054106 Thousands of dollars, if you have much more, well,But, what you have
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-054146-054237 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-054151-054616 Like very desperate. They do brutal things
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-054272-054434 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-054636-054884 Do you understand me? This is terrible. There has been too much social conscience reguarding the citizens. Now they are starting to oppose the issue.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-056294-056416 People now do oppose
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-056866-056957 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-056876-057361 There has been much more involvement.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-057240-057750 People didn't do it before
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-057472-057588 Yes. And because the security system didn't work. So someone declares a crime and
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-058321-058438 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-058559-058877 It was a lot of paperwork that did not work.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-058887-059125 Yeah
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-058918-059004 The policemen well reaffirming the action
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-060045-060176 Mm
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-060106-060591 People will feel there is more response, if more thieves and kidnappers are caught.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-060940-061056 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-061056-061208 Those reports
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-061218-061364 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-061309-061435 There was a march in Mexico a couple of years ago
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-062001-062077 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-062082-062224 About one and a half years ago. That was called the Silent March for the Security of Mexico, where everybody walked to
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-063149-063280 To the city Zocalo
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-063270-063401 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-063331-063684 And there were millions of people, it was crowded
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-063593-063679 Wow.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-063710-064074 I mean, you can see them, everyone dressed in white, and everyone in the streets
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-064033-064240 Wow, impressive!
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-064185-064301 Then, you can realize that is real, something socially needed. I mean, people is already
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-065135-065282 I understand
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-065186-065433 Much more attention to the security
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-065398-065600 No
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-065519-065757 Anything else
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-065605-065858 I don't know how it looks TV in Mexico
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-066556-066935 Causes the fear, right? Because news are very local and very
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-066995-067071 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-067238-067723 They explain each robbery over and over again in different ways.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-067516-067607 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-067754-067925 Actually
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-067794-068037 Yes too much sensationalism, let's say, right?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-068021-068542 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-068087-068153 But yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-068582-068679 And,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-068598-068860 In Mexio it is very excessive that
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-069664-069750 OK
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-069745-070104 Practically impossible to include every robbery or every
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-070053-070235 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-070144-070433 Rape, I don't know
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-070352-070422 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-070453-070640 Every mugging there is. It's just the ones that are really big. When there's a kidnapping
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-071085-071140 Sure
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-071206-071413 Bery drastic kidnappings.  It is like the case of the Juarez deaths.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-000000-000139 Alex and Besy
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-000154-000423 I see, it's Javier.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-000402-000485 Hello.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-000480-000810 Hello, how are you? I think this is good. I've never served as a jury but I'd like to do it someday. I don't know if you
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-001864-002199 I got a letter last year
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-002163-002308 Did you?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-002204-002550 I refused to serve on a jury.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-002602-002695 No, you know, I've heard that it's quite hard because it causes lots of trouble
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-003588-003681 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-003666-003903 Maybe you have problems. They have your record, your info about courts. It's safer that way.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-005080-005695 It's dangerous because it depends on which case you are serving
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-006309-006444 It's a
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-006325-006418 I see.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-006444-006975 If you get a murder case
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-007481-007569 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-007492-007678 What is it called?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-007647-008044 Well, a drug dealer or something?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-007936-007998 I see. They can have friends but let's say, okay he's guilty, so he can talk to his friends and say go after this person and kill his children.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-009196-009433 She looks like this
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-009800-009922 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-009919-010254 They can make your description and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-010255-010325 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-010275-010765 They can, that could happen too but I don't know they say that it's optional if they send you a letter
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-011669-011803 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-011669-011917 Is it optional or mandatory? I'm not sure, really.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-012237-012623 No, I received a letter that said no, but I sent a letter to the doctor
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-012986-013120 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-013017-013142 Saturday and Sunday.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-014323-014488 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-014323-014611 So, they said it was fine, they said it was okay for me not to serve on a jury
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-014824-015046 Sure
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-014869-015121 That was last year.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-015087-015552 Yes, a friend of mine got a letter like that. He's working from six in the morning to four in the afternoon. So, no he said.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-016120-016564 The manager of his company said he was someone who was not able to skip work, no?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-016877-017045 I guess that he asked him for a letter.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-017401-017545 Exactly.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-017421-017535 To be sent to the jury so that he
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-017576-017731 Yes, but I don't know. Somethings I think it'd be fine to attend in cases like
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-018666-018903 Rapes of boys and girls
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-018872-018970 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-018913-019197 Yes, you can serve as a jury and yes, how's that? If you can tell the person is guilty and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-019724-020235 You can help justice be served quickly. So I think it will be good to serve on a jury.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-020227-020396 I wouldn't want to be on one
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-020762-020896 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-020791-020877 Because I cry a lot, and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-021041-021387 Today, I cried.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-021376-021817 No, it's because if something happens or is about the rape of a child, or if they play a video, it's something,
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-022177-022714 I see, you wouldn't be able to stand it, if it's really horrible stuff
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-022399-022776 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-022869-023339 Where did you sent, the, in which state?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-023333-023491 No, I live in Canada
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-023499-023865 You are living in Canada.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-023617-023860 Yes, and you?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-023870-024072 I'm here in New York.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-024059-024155 Yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-024175-024795 I was trying to tell you about a friend of mine, he's in Arizona because I used to live in Arizona
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-024237-024335 I see.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-024851-025177 And then, do they have the same system in Canada,
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-025611-025915 I kind of believe, but I don't know.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-025936-026385 Oh, that's good. Well,
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-026049-026137 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-026395-026561 We have to be careful
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-027537-027786 We have to be careful, depends but they don't tell you of what, of what type of case, until you have arrived, perhaps, to where the judge or to the
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-028745-029055 Oh, or so you, no, eh
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-028815-028990 Where it has to be
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-029055-029648 I imagine that it should be a meeting or section to say, explain the case
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-029648-030206 It is everything that you will do it,
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-029829-030222 You are already involved
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-030206-030397 There is jury duty.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-030371-030893 There
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-030674-031146 There, and yes you said no, then I don't want to do it then, too late
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-031125-031487 No. Too late.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-031146-031522 They said yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-031523-031900 When was it your name
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-031857-031928 Besy. Besy, there
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-031936-032096 Petty, Sessy or Jessy?

20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-032395-032638 Oh, Besy.

20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-032700-033025 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-032829-033113 The mine is easy.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-033108-033495 Oh, are you living in Canada, then? How long?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-033134-033273 An e-mail address
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-033583-033820 Fifteen years
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-033702-033851 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-033846-034063 How can you resist the cold?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-034063-034445 Well, I lived in a town before where the winter was really cold and had enough snow.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-034693-034796 I see.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-034869-034977 Enough snow fell
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-034993-035096 Yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-035008-035390 And then, my husband and I decide to move to the beach
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-035586-035679 I see.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-035592-035767 In another province.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-035793-035984 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-035808-036175 And then here the winter is like rain
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-036160-036294 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-036175-036335 Doesn't get cold.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-036335-036924 I see and in what provinces or states?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-036444-036552 Is a province, is British Columbia, when I live is around to Vancouver, I don't know if you are going to the city
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-037580-038024 Vancouver, I see is not around of Washington State?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-037895-038230 More or less, already.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-038024-038173 Already, no. I had plans to go to Vancouver, because there were some friends from Bolivia.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-038994-039103 Oh, aha.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-039030-039748 But I lost the trail with them and I couldn't go, because they say to me that the life of them is very calm, I am not sure if this is true.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-039635-039872 A person with whom I spoke before told me you will live in a paradise, and I say: why?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-040672-040879 Because there are several islands all around and the Mar is very near and one can go to the United States.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-041189-041333 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-041509-041721 Do you have a passport
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-041695-041886 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-041731-041881 You can go alone, crossing the border.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-042020-042160 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-042056-042418 From here the border is about 10 minutes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-042402-042619 Yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-042418-042686 Yes, Washington, already.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-042655-042955 Where are you originally from?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-042939-043070 El Salvador
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-043043-043337 Yes, I see. I am from Ecuador.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-043310-043427 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-043461-043998 Yes, because you have a bit of an El Salvador accent, and some day I'll see if I can go there. Because here,
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-044184-044297 Already
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-044638-045335 Here much like the justice theme, here sometimes things aren't good
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-045341-045410 Ya and hay
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-045418-045717 And his. How?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-045676-045820 I'm sorry
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-045882-046001 Tell me
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-045977-046200 No. There is, how do you say it? That, let's say you kill someone and they give you the death penalty.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-046915-047080 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-046941-047297 Is there in some state from there?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-047308-047514 Here in the United States?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-047318-047561 The death penalty, yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-047535-047938 Of course, yes, they give you the chamber penalty of gas
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-047979-048123 Yes. But I was seeing something in the news the other day, that this woman killed her three children.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-048831-048965 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-048862-049275 She lives very close. Like at one, not even two miles of distance from here.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-049146-049358 Oh ya yes yes yes yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-049301-049435 And so my mother says, no, they should drown her and I say better they put her in jail because she'll suffer more
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-050209-050550 Other people in the jail know what she did.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-050395-050623 Ya
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-050550-050777 I say that they're going to piece I say
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-050974-051454 Of course, the mistreatmentor the bad step but imagine that a serial killer that killed someone
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-051970-052580 The gas chamber? Do they have to be punished? A few years
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-052342-052667 And, of course, something that will not cause suffering. Because if you kill one and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-052672-052931 Yeah, right.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-053029-053447 They suffered, what, ten minutes or whatever it was but if they put him in jail the other prisoners...
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-054056-054227 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-054134-054361 Poor thing
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-054330-054495 No.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-054366-054681 That people suffer I am saying.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-054650-055022 Clearly you can deduce that.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-055022-055373 He's going to pay for what he did.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-055435-055574 Why do people do things?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-056230-056323 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-056344-056669 Yeah, but then
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-056370-056705 Do you think that people are crazy?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-056726-056984 The people are crazy.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-056917-057051 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-056984-057325 And as I say here it's getting hard each time you listen to the comments that,Canada had were more calm.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-057882-058172 Now, there's something more calm.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-058203-058327 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-058316-058554 Because I imagine that the health care of the United Sates not as good.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-059473-059654 What do you call that card that they give you for health care? I don't know what it's called.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-059912-060413 I don't know here, Medicare
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-060598-060864 Yes, Medicare
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-060707-060882 Yeah.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-060903-061084 No, it's not so great.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-061110-061296 Yeah, exactly.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-061146-061306 Or is it?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-061296-061419 Over there?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-061445-061631 I would say that it's good
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-061771-062003 Just that it's more fair
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-061967-062261 Here it's more fair that
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-062277-062462 Today, that's great.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-062287-062488 Then, over there
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-062468-062850 What is the job market like here?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-062488-062607 Well they are looking for a lot of people to work construction
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-063619-063950 What kind of construction?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-063898-064316 Sure, I think it's for constructing buildings or something like that.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-064316-064456 Yeah.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-064332-064492 They asked in other states.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-064569-064889 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-064776-065230 If you have experience doing so build buildings or houses
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-065535-065685 I agree.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-065741-066175 Guess we can ask or visa, or something, I do not know
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-066149-066397 Not because
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-066201-066428 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-066475-066908 Because I was hearing that Canada needs a lot of people.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-067213-067435 At least in the province where I heard on the news yesterday that they were, they needed people to
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-068049-068235 For this to work on construction
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-068473-068824 Yes, there is a program, on the internet that if you accumulate points, as seventy-four points, and one would
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-069376-069697 Can go to work, and the government helps all
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-069711-069910 To where, here?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-069841-069981 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-069910-070198 Oh, Dever? I did not know that.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-070012-070146 Yes, it is.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-070198-070280 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-070301-070419 Yes. It is that you can
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-070450-070549 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-070585-070900 My interest in that activity is 50%.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-070895-070977 Yeah
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-071034-071194 Would be good
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-071204-071323 Okay
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-071359-071633 And have you ever had any problems with having to go to court or that?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-071788-072041 Me? No
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-071870-071989 Yes.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-000005-000151 Hello?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-001656-001983 Hello? Sorry.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-001731-001912 Hello, yes. No, It's fine, what is your name, where are you from?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-002285-002501 John from New York.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-002471-002758 My name is Jennifer, from New York
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-002526-002642 And you? I see.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-002758-003040 OK, so we are going to start this thing? finish quickly.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-003327-003422 Yes, what was, the topic? Did you hear it?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-003483-003664 The subject was interracial marriage
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-004338-004439 I didn't hear it well
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-004610-004998 Oh, yeah that was today's subject. So what do you think about interracial marriage?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-005436-005914 I don't care. After that, you are in love with someone
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-005743-005974 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-005949-006206 Yes, marry whoever you want
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-006135-006377 Okay. I
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-006302-006739 No. I don't think I care. Nobody should care either.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-006729-007167 It is easier for certain races to get married like whites and the Chinese.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-008154-008260 Not me
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-008154-008385 Lacks and hispanics, things like that, they wanted to know
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-008582-008798 I don't think that it is easier, but it is more no no better, because, like a Latin person with a Latina it depends where you live
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-009770-009865 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-009825-010087 Probably lots of people will criticize
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-010097-010384 Yes they always criticize, the do it if you get married
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-010389-010555 Yes, we are.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-010605-010887 Yes you are, if you marry a Spanish girl
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-010973-011194 Yes, but all the races, what race you are ?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-011134-011501 My father is Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-011491-011667 Mother?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-011501-011662 Both of them
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-011838-012080 Both Dominican fathers. Good, I'm Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-011939-012025 Yes, good, my husband is Puerto Rican too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-012286-012377 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-012312-012382 That was a problem too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-012588-012880 With his
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-012624-012815 With his family, obviously, they don't like Dominican people too much.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-013127-013293 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-013182-013288 Yes however, when you look around, the race doesn't count too much because my husband says that too. If we got into details
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-014199-014385 Of every family, it could be a family situation
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-014395-014481 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-014592-014728 In my family there are a lot of professionals, we're a lot more educated
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-015010-015156 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-015271-015513 In some economical things we are more stable
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-015835-016026 Yes, I
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-015951-016177 The only reason they had to not like me was that the last girlfriend, years before meeting me, was Puerto Rican.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-016867-017214 And I'm from Dominican parents, born here, raised here.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-017174-017380 Yes, I have some Dominican family
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-017496-017687 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-017612-017909 I have many cousins married to Dominicans.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-017728-017874 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-017909-018145 And they have dump.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-018070-018271 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-018166-018478 Divorced and else
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-019122-019399 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-019208-019701 I have a lot of Dominican friends. They are my family.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-019585-020038 Yes, I can't understand the ignorance.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-020023-020471 I have a family also. My cousins are married to brown guys.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-020038-020144 Yes, my sister in law is Afro American, she,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-020813-020994 Yes, where from New York are you?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-020929-021115 How?

20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-021156-021367 Manhattan
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-021302-021478 I'm in the Bronx
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-021377-021604 She was born in New York
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-022585-022872 That's what I think too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-022832-023244 I get it, and for me it's not so big when both are happy
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-023199-023446 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-023244-023778 No, I care less they are green or yellow,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-023662-023949 I went out with different types of girls
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-024025-024342 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-024271-024412 I don't care. My first girlfriend was Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-024880-025001 Ok, and then, the funny thing is we're not all equal
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-025006-025117 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-025449-025857 Because I have some family members of my own that I don't get along with very well.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-025459-025545 I have some Dominican friends
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-025862-026139 I don't like them
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-026194-026401 They stated their Dominican, don't tell anyone that they are, they treat Dominicans bad.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-026848-026994 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-026859-027196 Because of that, they are a bit rude and all, and he says I have, and they don't because their family says that, too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-027463-027699 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-027473-027815 How they call them sometimes, rude, and all that stuff and the are
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-027709-027926 She's two, right?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-027865-028026 They are quite nasty
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-027991-028187 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-028026-028474 They feel ashamed to see. I said, that does not need to make them feel ashamed, because it is there in all races.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-028208-028389 I love telling people in my professional life I talk with all kinds of people.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-029370-029597 Where are you from? I am Dominican.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-029511-029793 I know one guy,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-029647-029843 I believe it was you
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-030025-030080 No I know a guy who is a policeman, I am a policeman, right?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-030432-030528 Hm mm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-030488-030568 And me, he always, he has tattoos with the Puerto Rico flag
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-030820-031087 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-031062-031132 And I always thought he was Puerto Rican, until two or three weeks ago, when we made a barbeque for no more than three weeks, to say summer goodbye.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-032073-032234 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-032164-032662 He was talking there and the wife was talking there. They said he made the vows to the flag and he was not Dominican. He made
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-032692-032823 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-033171-033432 Such, like when he made himself a citizen here
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-033422-033488 Hmm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-033447-033911 And he always said that he was Puerto Rican and changed all his documents to tell that he is Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-033865-034026 But this is
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-033956-034182 He was not born here, but he changed everything that the parents
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-034243-034610 Your friend is ignorant
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-034525-034922 I said, but why did you do it, then he said, because those people don't talk to me. He doesn't
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-034640-034741 You know
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-034947-035255 He doesn't want to know anything Dominica. There are Puerto Ricans who don't want to know anything from Puerto Ricans.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-035567-035843 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-035662-035879 I am Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-035869-036040 It is that, no?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-035884-036100 They never change. I don't know why you should change it.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-036065-036427 Exactly
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-036100-036246 I am I am an American, Puerto Rican American
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-036518-036901 That is he doesn't have, I'm sorry, that is ignorance.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-036790-037092 I am Dominican, I can't change it.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-037228-037439 Yeah, that.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-037338-037978 Not like him, who has been paying and paying to change everything.  He says he is Puerto Rican and from New York
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-037625-037802 And still you, being you, know that they have nothing to do with that.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-038129-038194 Hm mm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-038159-038436 That doesn't change at all because still.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-038406-038667 Where I am working now
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-038667-038748 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-038692-038889 Here in the Bronx there are many Dominicans.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-039342-039503 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-039463-039981 Lots of people say, Oh, the Dominicans are gross, they don't know how to do anything.  There's a lot of Dominicans.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-039885-040238 There are classes in all the races.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-040187-040449 There are more Dominicans than whites
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-040429-040686 And now because of this you have Dominicans, that love to multiply.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-040832-040932 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-041053-041239 Have kids.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-041063-041250 No and then the Puerto Ricans don't say anything. Because like they say, the more Hispanics come, more Latinos, the better.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-041723-041828 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-041738-042171 The little whites are the ones that have a lot of Dominican and this one
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-041838-042291 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-042211-042543 Puerto Ricans all one one of these.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-042513-042775 You know, this
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-042553-042634 So.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-042800-042936 Yeah, I feel like speaking English, I can't, we can't
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-043233-043565 I know, I'm getting up there too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-043550-043741 This is because the brother is a policeman here in Manhattan.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-043983-044174 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-044073-044295 I'm in my thirties and have a house.  I work mostly with policemen, some investigations.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-045463-045548 Yea
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-045513-045719 In that
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-045629-045734 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-045719-045795 Just a moment. So, I always say, where are you from? Then they talk to me for a while, after I helped them, Dominican people say things in front of me
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-047139-047466 They said oh yes, where are you from? Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-047697-048055 Yes,  I speak like Dominican.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-047738-047869 Oh.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-048055-048352 But
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-048145-048412 Yes. No.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-048352-048679 There are some who speak of them, and they fall  until they get the point
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-049127-049394 Oh, yes. No.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-049213-049414 Sometimes we are talking in a group. Look he is a Dominican, so dirty, but I am talking with the group
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-049479-049716 Ok
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-049791-050003 Two or three dominicans, with two or three Puerto Ricans
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-049927-050119 OK
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-050003-050229 We chat like this.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-050129-050239 Yes because
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-050229-050360 But
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-050239-050632 You can criticize a person and describe them like that Dominican in that corner
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-051156-051704 Yes. Because when I watch people on the street, I know they are Dominicans because they have a flag or something.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-051176-051342 Okay
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-051704-051845 I am Dominican, I came
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-051835-052016 Exactly, yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-051850-052036 This way.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-052016-052218 You know them because the worst Dominicans are always painted and have tattoos.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-052691-052781 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-052741-052927 They have a shirt.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-052832-052988 Also like women
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-052973-053063 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-052988-053189 From a distance for a reason.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-053144-053255 Oh yeah? But we are not all like that. That is a funny thing because when I was in college it was Oh, where are you from?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-054307-054473 New York, what ethnicity are you? I'm Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-054855-054921 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-055041-055273 I do not think so
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-055082-055213 Turn around
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-055293-055585 Unfortunately that's a trait we all have. But its the point of
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-056124-056406 We are...
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-056788-056959 Yeah,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-056869-057015 No, no I don't mean that we are all the same.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-057221-057296 Yea
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-057226-057573 Because I have cousins that make me ashamed, because they're sluts, basically
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-057669-057744 No, I didn't mean it that way. I meant it with the second part.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-057815-057976 No, I understand. But let's get to the heart of it.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-058449-058565 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-058474-058756 They are like that
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-058666-058751 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-058756-058917 We all inherited my grandmother's nice bottom
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-059667-059979 Right, it is always that way.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-059743-059949 But
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-059979-060171 So what? if they are sluts, like you said
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-060347-060468 No
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-060387-060508 Puertorican,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-060498-060674 Eh, we all have one.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-060513-060755 Dominicans, hell yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-060699-061001 So it's like, but, I don't that such a simple thing like you know you are Puertorican, I am Dominican,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-061354-061696 Look at me and my family, with their own cousins, and everything.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-061802-061968 No. Okay, now. But
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-061892-062179 I know that for a fact
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-062003-062255 Yeah, but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-062491-062592 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-062491-062733 Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are like ninety miles apart? We're closer than Florida and Cuba
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-063040-063125 Yea
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-063110-063488 We hate each other just because of where we were born, what is that?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-063402-063483 Dominicans and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-063951-064348 Exactly, but I
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-064097-064218 The computer checking out the chatrooms
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-064354-064645 Hm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-064635-064882 It's crazy how we are fighting.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-064832-065194 It makes me laugh. I usually don't tell people until I'm asked but I never deny my race.  People will say something and I'll stand and say hold up.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-065421-065582 Yes. I asked you why you're from New York because
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-065758-065949 Mm hm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-065929-066125 What part of New York, you sound like you're white
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-066266-066548 Get out of here.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-066312-066624 Yeah, you sound white.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-066563-066860 Thank you so much. I speak Spanish like a white person, too?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-066795-066865 But nothing, of course. Not now. Let the Spanish come out.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-067016-067213 That's another thing that bothers me. Just because a person is like that doesnt mean that they are white
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-068330-068421 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-068365-068798 You know what I'm saying.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-068421-068914 I told them I was from Bronx and they hung up while I had three callers
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-068798-068874 Hmm.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-068914-069045 They hang up on me.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-068989-069281 No abs, please; I'll tell everybody I don't care.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-069156-069427 In Florida Disney World.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-069312-069422 Hmm.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-069427-069629 It was a line and we were standing, the line was moving but they weren't moving.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-069830-070041 I see
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-069926-070268 I had said, Bronx, New York. And they said, Oh, honey, come on, they're from the Bronx. And they moved, and they got off the line like
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-070605-070812 Out embarrassed.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-070786-071068 No, it's not your fault
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-070827-070998 I was like oh well
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-071068-071255 Your fault is not to, people act ignorant around me all the time and say stupid things like that and it's like
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-071798-071919 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000010-000090 Hi?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000106-000176 Yes. Hello?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000197-000328 Hi, good night.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000323-000449 Good night. How are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000490-000626 Fine. Who am I talking to?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000631-000717 David
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000758-001112 David. It's Joe.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000869-000925 How are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-001243-001541 Where do you live?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-001536-001870 Here at Connecticut, I think I already talk with you like a week ago
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-001754-001809 Yes, how are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-002016-002133 Yes it was cut off by the call right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-002274-002481 Yes, I don't know why
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-002461-002648 I don't know why it was cut off
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-002532-002603 Oh. Yes. I don't know what they are going to do with that, because they have
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-002679-002770 Howdy! How are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-003007-003361 So many calls had been cut off, and it also seems that
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-003422-003482 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-003674-004129 There is a lot of people that, I don't know, there is so many calls that they haven't processed. Therefore, it seems to me that they don't know how many valid calls
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-004690-004994 I don't know what they are going to do. For example, my mother already has reached the twenty five calls
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-005029-005120 Yes?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-005484-005651 She knows that there were several calls that didn't cut out. So, she doesn't know what to do, right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-006212-006495 They still call you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-006475-006834 Yes, they still call her. I don't know, two weeks ago, yesterday they were calling here. But, I think they still are, I don't know. But,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-007364-007693 They pay her just for twenty five, right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-007657-007804 I think so. But, yes, in the end, it doesn't seem very well organized to me and it surprises me because
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-008754-009265 The LDC did that a lot of times.  Last time was about two years or a year and a half ago.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-009553-009695 Do it in English
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-009558-009649 But, before, it was in English, but they also had it in Arabic and Spanish. But yes, that's already an old story. They've already done it lots of times, so, I don't know, or at least once.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-010857-010918 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-010989-011378 I DON'T KNOW NOW ALL OF A  SUDDEN NEW AGAIN
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-011560-011914 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-011686-011747 No,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-011984-012283 It's pretty clear, because, the other time they had the topic, it was about religion,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-012763-012834 And they were like for fifteen or twenty days it was all.the same topic.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-013258-013551 I think the recorder was some type of computer
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-014385-014451 Yea
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-014461-014679 And that is what they tell her. My theory is they write the text in English, what they want her to say
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-015639-015806 That you could hear it. Right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-015791-015882 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-015806-016084 They went to the translator and put the text there
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-016099-016170 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-016463-016609 From English to Spanish, they occupied a computer or there are programs that don't.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-017706-018080 Put a lot of text then computer reads it.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-018075-018202 Right,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-018202-018652 I imagine it was something like this
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-018323-018379 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-018652-018889 Then, what it talked about,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-018677-018737 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-018889-019182 I imagine that it was a computer.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-019172-019344 Of course
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-019182-019698 It didn't have a bad accent, but everything that it sad was when the calls ended
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-020057-020244 Your time is above.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-020279-020719 I never saw it often, because when
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-020613-021103 I didn't understand anything.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-021482-021558 Yes.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-021497-021856 Yes.  Your time is above.  At one time the topis was dateing.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-022549-022675 Then,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-022584-022685 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-022685-022893 The translation in Spanish was to date. How do you like to date it? Things like that, that are
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-023994-024085 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-024005-024080 Incredible. But, obviously they have people who speak Spanish, right? I do not know.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-024768-025021 Yeah, it depends.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-024930-025172 It has not been very well organized,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-025182-025865 If you send them an email they answer you, The next day.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-025551-025668 Yes Shudong but the good thing is that they pay well.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-026881-027058 It's not a big deal, they pay well.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-027204-027492 I did it other time and it was over
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-027750-027801 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-027755-027831 And I don't know what happened. They didn't call me again, and didn't have a phone number to call them but they sent me a check.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-028584-028660 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-028604-028908 You know, about sixty days ago, they sent me a check.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-029069-029135 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-029282-029550 Until I forgot it. I never knew
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-029560-029843 A surprise
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-029787-029949 Do you live in Philadelphia?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-030146-030399 My mom lives in the outskirts of Philadelphia and I live in West Philly.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-030894-030980 Okay.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-030970-031162 Then at the University.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-031177-031374 Oh, because you live in the outskirts too. Don't you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-031187-031329 That here
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-031450-031713 In school, you guys go to Penn State?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-031663-031865 University of Pennsylvania is different. All the world is confused by that because Penn State
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-032689-032987 It is located in the center of the state.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-032719-032795 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-033007-033346 And it is a public University
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-033356-033417 Right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-033391-033604 And so the university where I am it's the University of Pennsylvania
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-034013-034205 In two diffferent, so
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-034185-034695 The other its much bigger and is public it is the countryside
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-035034-035302 Yes those that are and another thing like that. No?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-035322-035489 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-035701-035838 Where the wilds are.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-035939-036419 I have never been there, so I don't know exactly where it is
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-035964-036045 Over there.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-036419-036697 The eighty one I think will be more
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-037379-037460 Possibly, because I know that the eighty one
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-038446-038582 For mine, it is the same
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-038456-038830 Yes all that I know of the eighty one is that, because we used to live in Tennessee
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-039103-039219 Northeast
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-039149-039341 Alright
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-039240-039452 We were living in virginia, but then we moved to Tennesse, but then we found out that the eighty-one passed through there, but that's all I know.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-040139-040261 Okay
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-040311-040402 It seems like a long highway, but, are you finished or you still studying?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-041459-041631 I don't work, I wish I could work and also go to school.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-041646-041721 Okay.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-041924-042171 I'm
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-042060-042318 It's a lot easier to imagine
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-042247-042601 When you're at school, you find friendship, you don't have to go out to talk to friends.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-043187-043445 Not, the whole world relies in the center, in the same center
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-043445-043566 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-043475-043981 But then, one is done and has to go home, and has to pay the costs of the house. It's hard. It's better to stay in school.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-044289-044618 The good thing about being in university is that when someone is done, one's costs rise
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-045159-045578 Fixed payments, fixed responsibilities?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-046058-046190 You need to have an effort
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-046518-046751 A lot
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-047049-047155 No.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-047110-047287 The ramens sell for 20 cents.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-047540-047696 Oh, yes.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-047681-048424 If one could live off of ramon soups, it would only cost you twenty five cents to eat dinner. But then again, it isn't that way.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-047696-047787 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-048429-048692 You don't spend much less, but it's a life more calm, yes it's calm, but I think too that when the people remember when they were students, forget everything else so in the workplace really?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-049809-049925 Yes, sure
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-049885-050097 Its a life that has more freedom, flexibility in time
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-050790-050987 Every night I'm awake, studying and I don't have class tomorrow.  Don't care really because I sometimes don't want to go to class.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-051967-052180 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-052038-052493 You can't say, Oh, yea I didn't want to go to work today.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-052453-052695 That does not happen.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-052513-052665 No, it is very flexible.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-052756-052837 No, your skills
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-053267-053337 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-053272-053585 When you go to school everybody calms down.  The have family or are married.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-053964-054379 They have children, and their life is harder.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-054394-054556 A lot of people do not; because of the income rise obviously the work responsibilities you have.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-054515-054894 Yes. So if you want to live life like the Americans, I am going to tell you that you know the American dream.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-055238-055657 The American dream is they want to buy a house and other
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-055253-055334 The trouble is that I feel its that you have to be happy with what you have
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-056825-056992 A lot, right? so, one has to buy a car, and you want one, then another. So then one would have to start working, right? So that you could maintain yourself, while a student just lives there.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-057998-058119 But can it be at the same time?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-058003-058079 Right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-058180-058559 Everything that one consumes. One goes to buy a better car, and one may do one thing or another. And then when one sees the money is gone, and one stays there, it looks like the responsibilities only fall on me. Right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-059666-059727 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-059671-059818 I don't know. Right now I am happy as a student, but for now. Right? But eventually, of course, one has to save to buy a house. But,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-061031-061410 I don't know, that is scary to me, having so many overheads. Right? Because, it's that one works
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-061435-061501 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-061703-061779 And one feels one is not enjoying money. But also that, in part, is because one doesn't think of all the benefits that it gives to one person. But also
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-062759-062987 One has a car to go to work. Right? So, one has to have this, so that one has to cut the grass. I don't know, it seems like a lot to me.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-062997-063108 Right.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-063614-063730 A sample.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-064210-064574 You have more responsibilities in life.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-064574-064766 Yes, definitely.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-064604-064726 But, you know, being poor in life is more difficult.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-065034-065191 Yes,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-065069-065747 The life of being poor, has nothing to do nothing. If you want to work, you work, if you don't want to work, you maintain it
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-065711-065959 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-065868-065964 You know
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-065959-066202 The wife maintains him.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-066121-066343 More or less the same thing
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-066232-066328 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-066363-066823 You have to get one good woman who could help you, who has a house or an apartment, who helps you
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-067359-067465 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-067390-067678 Life is like this.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-067673-067764 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-067678-067794 Live and learn
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-067804-067930 I think that there is. It is because of that, that one has to be careful 
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-068679-068840 If you buy a house and then buy another you're not going to enjoy money
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-069775-069922 You have to be serious to see
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-069780-069846 Right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-069932-070175 What do you like to do?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-070215-070276 No but
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-070458-070872 And if not, it is not that. Then it is better not to spend money on that. Right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-070908-071231 You tell me. The large companies are giving you stuff.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-070918-071034 This is what it seems to me.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-071231-071661 Big companies they give you cars, no money down? They give you the stuff
