20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-018722-018839 Of course.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-026577-026770 Women are beautiful. They have to dress up, because they are not going to go like that all the time.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-026951-027073 Natural.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-027240-027538 Exactly.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-030429-030763 So, why not, it is as I say.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-030768-030844 None
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-030773-030869 Fine. One must

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-031410-031652 I took them to the church

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-033007-033674 Speaking of the lady that would be leaving, if she believed that she was going to a party, and her clothing were

20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-033907-034003 Yes
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-034650-035135 That she was going to a party that didn't seem to be in a church.

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-035171-035368 I looked at her and said,

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-035378-035757 How would she be talking of that if she loves God?

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-037021-037486 If you are going to church so that you use that to gossip about the others.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-037344-037460 Exactly.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-037496-037764 You are not supposed to gossip about people.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-037673-037814 Exactly, yes.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-037829-038082 But, she was like, I looked to here and said wow, my God, if she talks like this here, how does she

20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-068446-068764 I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk to God, because even in your own bed, you can talk with God.
20051009_182032_217_fsp-A-069229-069351 Yes, mam
20051009_182032_217_fsp-B-069280-069629 I can't continue asking father God alone How is it? We only remember father God when we have problems and not all of the time.

20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000020-000136 Hi?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-000116-000307 Hi, I'm Milgred from Connecticut
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000287-000550 Mercedes is from Florida
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-000524-000706 How are you? Good night.

20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-000777-000857 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-000928-001211 Let's see what we can talk about religion then
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-001150-001594 Do you believe that join or disjoints
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-001695-001892 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-001756-002068 Or do you believe that if everybody were the same religion, we will be better or equal? Or it will be
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-002386-002820 What I believe is that
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-002487-002694 Will the world be better?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-002820-003007 Somebody saying that we are all the same religion? It's impossible, because I think that there are always going to be cultural differences.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-003567-003724 Yeah
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-003628-003825 Each person interprets unique religion its own way.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-004486-004763 Yes, I believe it's the same and we aren't the same race so, each race has its own
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-005222-005429 It's doctrine. Although we are Hispanic, some of us acquire another in that sometimes they aren't either. Sometimes, some of us are a Catholic family and others in the family are
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-006706-006958 Are they adventists or evangelical?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-007402-007544 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-007493-007640 Or they are from this others, the ones of the taballas, the ones who sells, I forgot their name
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-008916-009451 There are a lot of races and religions.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-009633-009764 0
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-009744-010102 Don't get bothered with other religions.  share with any other religion as long as they don't try to put me in something I don't want
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-010980-011283 Exactly, not including you.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-011263-011520 Not being fanatics, right?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-011283-011596 The oppose it, but they don't feel forced.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-011566-011677 Yeah
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-011707-011904 Talking to you, I think that it's that, what is it called, that the religion is separated because of difference.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-013276-013735 In which one believes, the, the differences always exist.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-013670-013912 Religion is like politics.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-013857-014074 Exactly.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-013947-014497 It depends on what point you look at it, Not the whole world will be in agreement, follow me?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-014366-014492 That is why they say that one should never discuss religion. Not because, for that, I can't believe they put us to discuss religion in this show.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-015290-015441 Mm hm, yeah, but it's good that they discuss everything, because if you look at it, I have aunts and cousins who belong to the evangelic religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-016516-016627 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-016622-016935 And the rest of them are Catholics.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-016915-017036 Hm mm
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-017026-017485 And in the other side of my family there are some who are absenteeism.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-017455-017535 Hm
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-017485-017813 O one is talking of religion, an no one is talking about, you know, that you have to be this way, and you have to change, nothing.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-018767-019089 My cousin's husband is an evangelical, you will almost always find him in the church.she does not belong to the church. They have a happier marriage than most.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-019917-020396 She is only there on special occasions, mostly for ceremonies for mothers
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-021037-021335 But they celebrate that because they do not celebrate Christmas. There are also other times
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-021582-021759 Who are they?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-021739-021885 The evangelicals
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-021804-021915 Okay
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-021885-022274 Evangelicals -- My cousin's husband says that he was not married by that religion, but they did get married at the church.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-023015-023222 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-023076-023263 She dances, and she drinks, and he accompanied her to work and to the party
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-023969-024055 You haven't told anyboyd, you still have to stop smoking and drinking protein
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-024807-025095 If you make jokes of you at the party, rather than getting cranky, you know that this is not a big deal so you should just have a good time
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-025821-026043 Yes, you can get a person like that, it all depends on the person. But if they become fans, forget about it.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-026957-027179 This is what happened in my house
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-026987-027143 That is
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-027189-027476 My mom is that religious
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-027426-027532 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-027486-027673 My dad did not believe in church. He never said why.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-027885-028243 That is like my cousin as well.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-028173-028390 All of us went to Catholic school
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-028728-028849 Oh, really?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-028773-029015 Yes, always Christians, well
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-029293-029429 Uh huh.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-029379-029480 That which we learned in school, we didn't reinforce at home.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-030116-030257 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-030171-030509 My oldest sister is Catholic, my younger sister is Evangelical, and I don't have a religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-031569-031857 You're not going to church or anything.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-031771-032053 No
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-032043-032104 No
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-032053-032149 No
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-032240-032810 I am going to the church, they call a pious woman, stuck there all the the church
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-032709-032780 Not me, since I was married of that I went out, I went to the university, and I left the university, I already decided that I wasn't going to return to the
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-033754-034082 To a church, not me. The truth, that's interesting to me. The organized religion, no
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-035026-035202 You don't like it.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-035101-035631 Well, I feel that I keep God in my heart. Not that I don't like it.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-035873-035949 I understand
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-035929-036186 I live my life well. I married my husband he's Jewish, and my son is Jewish too, and we're going to bring him up Jewish.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-037069-037160 Uh huh.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-037125-037337 I do believe that one needs to grow up with a religion
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-037680-038094 I think that it's a very important base, especially for the children.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-037932-037993 Yes, definitely. I
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-038114-038573 One raises them with something
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-039214-039315 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-039259-039623 They don't create a relationship with feelings towards anything.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-039890-040057 Okay.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-039946-040203 It is like they don't care about anything.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-040132-040218 Yes, I agree that the kids do need well. And that's why they say
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-040980-041429 What a miracle that they accepted you in his family.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-041636-041772 Yes? yes they are, really yes.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-041883-042090 How do you say it? They are
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-042030-042257 Yes, we were lucky.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-042090-042459 They all have the same religion and so they try to marry among themselves.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-042817-043100 They are very, strict
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-043594-043705 Aha
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-043660-043922 But no, my husbands family have always been very understanding. Also the other son got married, the girls, she's not either
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-044528-044962 Jewish. And I imagine that maybe I was the second one. They didn't
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-044846-045224 But did you get marries by the Jewish, or did you get married by the Catholics?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-045148-045527 No, we had a religious and Jewish ceremony.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-045497-045779 How nice
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-045618-045986 Yes, and let's say then what I am saying, my son is going to be raised and I say it's important that he's raised with a religion
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-046334-046415 0
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-046375-046728 He will decide wha to do when he is an adult.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-046501-046753 And what did they say?
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-046753-047132 I believe a child must be raised with a defined religion.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-048121-048428 My youngest girl, the one that is bigger, they got baptized and are Catholic, but the youngest, though she was baptized in the catholic church, she also visits the church
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-049579-049771 The Evangelical church.

20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-049831-050094 She doesn't have the chance to be bad
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-050856-051219 Their religion and she likes going with them, and I never told her no. When they asked me if they could take her, I
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-051608-051739 You know
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-051608-051905 I don't understand that, because when my mom goes to church she has to wear a skirt.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-052491-052798 I tell her why it is bad to wear pants
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-052834-053212 I think the Bible says that pants are worn by men.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-053465-054020 That was one of the
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-053535-053692 It is related with that.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-054045-054232 Reasons, really not get away but from a little of what organized religion is, there are people who when it comes ot the Bible, too strict, well, they take it
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-055357-055407 Those are the ones who become fanatic, that
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-055634-055806 Yes.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-055735-056210 They interpret what is written word for word.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-056149-056296 Hmmm
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-056240-056553 It is like the the Iraqis with their doctrine that who kill people
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-057169-057451 The God they had, or what they believe.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-057416-057587 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-057527-057764 Sometimes there is people with their minds, distorted
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-057986-058122 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-058042-058470 Interpreting things that should be unifying. Because religion must unify, no matter which one. Do you Understand?, I don't think that only because two humans are from different religions they
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-059449-059651 Must kill each other
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-059994-060095 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-060095-060186 I don't become a fan of anything. I was raised Catholic.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-061271-061614 I helped at church, I belonged to the Mary's Daughter Club
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-062174-062513 It has always been my faith, the Catholic Church. I took my children to church and I baptized them, because that's how I was raised
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-063234-063411 If they want't to go somewhere, you must understand,
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-064148-064400 You can't believe in that, because the catholic church says it's different
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-064698-064849 None
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-064748-065036 And the great amount of evangelic or Jehovah's witnesses people try to force things up to your brain. They want to come to your home early and start to sell whatever they have
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-066191-066565 Sometimes they knock and I thank them and say: I have your book, And if they insist I say I'm catholic
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-066827-067211 I understand that so many kind of people exist.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-067054-067286 They are no prudent
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-067216-067841 They want to transform people into their religion, but they don't respect
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-068003-068114 Yes
20051009_210519_219_fsp-B-068058-068164 Right? It might be me, but
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-068351-068846 I had a lady that came to look
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-069401-069855 You're in sin, what do I know, but I've been a sinner since I was born. So let the Lord punish me when I get up there.
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-070486-071126 If they try to, I don't know they go and say such negative things, instead of saying well look, you can know the lord better, and what do I know,
20051009_210519_219_fsp-A-071333-071616 I keep sinning and you're sinning right now talking like that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-000056-000597 Hello

20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-003276-003590 Very good. And what do you do in Georgia, study or work?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-003664-004124 No, I take care of my kid. I am a housewife.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-004014-004186 Okay,  very good and your husband is also from
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-004838-005156 Peruvian? No, my husband isn't.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-004930-005065 Peruvian American
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-005231-005494 Yes my husband is American
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-005391-005686 Okay. Very good.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-005614-006081 What do you think about religions?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-006098-006454 Well, I think that from the times of like medieval and that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-006989-007112 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-007014-007149 Religion was lost during industrialization. Religion stopped being something spiritual.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-008104-008190 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-008120-008317 And became something more political and then lately now in the last time has ceased to be so political but even so it still keeps bringing many of the ones that are
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-008996-009069 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-009104-009319 Like the institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-009620-009737 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-009639-009885 But not necessarily in favor of an institution. And you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says, or in favor of what is said.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-010549-011040 THE CATHOLIC ONE OR MUSLIM ONE YOU CAN HERE AMONG THE TOPIC THE PHILOSOPHIES ALL OF THEM
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-012006-012196 Use them to follow a good path of life more than anything
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-012633-012719 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-012645-012756 What do you think?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-012811-012957 Well I I am very religious, I belong to a religion that is the Hare Krishna religion, I don't know if you have heard of it
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-013586-013776 I don't know very well how they are, what is the Hare Krishna about
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-013813-013946 It's based on Hindu philosophy
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-014428-014569 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-014512-014925 First we believe that you are a part or portion of God and we also believe in reincarnation. We have rules and regulations. We're vegetarian, we don't eat meat, eggs or fish
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-015606-015931 We don't drink alcohol.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-015909-016278 Why not? Why don't you eat meat? Why do you think that?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-016196-016463 Because for us, we believe that every life animal deserves respect, we have to avoid violence.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-017397-017606 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-017482-018191 We don't eat meat or intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-018209-018270 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-018229-018434 We don't drink coffee or tea.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-018479-018559 Yeah
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-018523-018683 We don't play around.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-018756-018977 No playing around games.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-018922-019038 No, and are you from any religion?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-019161-019241 I don't belong to any institution for the moment. I grew up catholic, but now I'm twenty one years old.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-020600-020950 I stopped following the institution around eighteen because I didn't have much interest in it
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-021879-022536 I felt that it was already in my spirit
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-022389-022481 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-022567-023145 With- not God, I didn't have to go to the institution to get that, so I started to read other religions. But more than anything,
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-024190-024737 But to get an interest, and lets say practice life
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-024712-024803 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-024811-025155 But I'm not, I don't like the institutions
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-025147-025309 But you believe in god
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-025303-025561 Yes, definitively. However,
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-025459-026092 That's really nice. Sometimes, you don't feel connected to a group of people.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-025942-026071 Exactly
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-026092-026770 The really important thing is to have God in your heart and develop a relationship with God.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-026434-026563 Knowing if it really is
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-027068-027247 Well it was to Utah and I met my husband there.  Now we are living in Idaho.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-027104-027362 A girl?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-027307-027383 Of course
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-027387-027528 Sometimes, related to that, it has changed so much, in fact, I study chemical engineering and sometimes people think that in science you tend to
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-028635-028997 To brake religion, to currupt it
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-028887-028985 Yes.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-029010-029569 People who start studying scientific things are normally really religious
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-030030-030559 When they start knowing, themselves, they can explain.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-030565-030670 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-030571-030915 You have more questions but understand that the world is not understandable.  There are miracles everywhere!
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-031665-031948 I feel that there must be a supreme chaos and a divinity behind everything.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-032749-033123 A supreme being which controls everything
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-033153-033227 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-033177-033672 Religions, or beliefs, have a supreme being to help people be closer.  That way, in times of catastorphes of pain, you always
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-034297-034593 Ask God for help. Everyone. There are some people called atheists, and they are always desperate.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-035292-035695 They don't ask, they turn their faces like that from asking god to help them
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-035299-035379 Yes that is it.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-035695-035914 It's just it's in their heart, right? you just feel that there really is a supreme being that many times doesn't.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-036436-037118 You don't turn to religion only to ask for help, but also to thank
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-036575-036672 Um of course
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-037143-037334 I think that many times, people become religious at certain times because they need help, but once they're ok, they forget.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-038077-038148 Yes, that's why you don't in our philosophy, there's always a future a verse that says that when you're suffering.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-038846-038932 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-038873-038978 One always asks God for help and one should really ask God to send more suffering because you remember him more
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-040161-040536 When you're OK , you forget your relationship with GOD.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-040518-040702 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-040561-041145 When you do fine, you're very happy.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-041034-041102 Yes, you don't remember
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-041157-041674 No, then you think that you are in control, not that he is, that you are in control of everything that happens and that one does the work, right?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-041729-041815 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-042411-043254 No, but it's really that God blesses you and helps you in many circumstances.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-043217-043352 Yes, true.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-043395-043450 And, do you have a notion about reincarnation or something like that? Have you heard something about karma, have you read?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-044114-044600 Well, I have heard about karma, and how karma is brought upon people. Right. If you had bad karma, you will reincarnate in another being, but for
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-044915-044976 I unnderstand
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-045516-045750 To improve it, not just clean it you have another opportunity to do your karma something good
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-046240-046325 Yes OK the karma law is the law of action and reaction, that one person in agreement of his positive or negative activities it has a reaction positive or negative
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-047520-047643 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-047538-047588 We said many times. Why there are so many things that happen to people
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-048278-048761 Reactions of their past lives that we realize actions very negatives and now it's from the negative reaction that they are suffering
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-049069-049229 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-049100-049929 No, it's not that there aren't people that are very innocent or very good people. It's just a reaction, like free will.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-049990-050362 Not to do what we wish, God doesn't force us to believe in him, doesn't force us to serve or do devotional service for that
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-050372-050459 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-050816-051052 We have our free will. If we do negative activities many times there is a infallible reaction of the karma law. No body is free of the karma law.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-051670-051706 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-051999-052374 That's what we think, what we believe, no?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-052057-052198 Oh, I see. The Hare Krishna.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-052426-052680 Yes in our religion
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-052684-053415 Do you gather with the hare krishna every week or everyday
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-053323-053848 Yes I mean now I am married I live here in apparment near to the temple we have
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-053858-054147 OK
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-053880-054122 The temple here in georgia and  atlanta, but before a live in the temple, It is  like an internal there, I was doing service not to krishna not to God
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-054399-054504 Yes
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-054746-055374 No, there are many kinds of services that we do- one if preach, one is sing the name saints of Lord, one is kitchen for the Lord, we offer food to God.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-055611-055822 And do many different activities.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-055819-055930 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-055899-057006 The center of your life is God.You offer him everything all your deeds, your meals and when you wake up in the morning you go to the altar and pray
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-057006-057265 Offer him our food, I'm married and I have kids so I have to take care of them
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-057756-057946 Sure
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-057883-058633 I always go to the temple and we are devout. Many people come on Sundays or in big celebrations that we have during the year.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-058633-058785 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-058647-058758 Do you have something like a prophet, like Jesus Christ?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-059278-059719 We have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada who is a devout of God and brought this knowledge to the West
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-060516-060590 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-060562-060635 We really don't honor him
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-061143-061272 What's his name again?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-061156-061653 He respects Jesus Christ, too. It's because we respect other religions, other beliefs.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-061530-061678 Sure
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-061653-062509 He brought that knowledge about Krishna to the West. We named it after the city.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-062446-062834 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-062680-062784 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-062877-063110 What's the name of the man again?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-063063-063153 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-063165-063338 What's his name?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-063334-063679 It's called International Society for the Krishna.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-063639-064100 What's the name of the man that brought you?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-064079-064155 His name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-064579-065022 Where does he come from? Is he Hindu?
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-064866-064933 He was born in India
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-065157-065323 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-065253-065672 He is no longer in the planet. He already died and abandoned his body.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-065631-065809 But rather, it is very possible that he has reincarnated in someone else, or he won't reincarnate because it has Karma.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-066545-067082 Rather, he is considered a pure devotee to God, and he returned to the spiritual world.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-067069-067321 Okay, then he will no long reincarnate
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-067116-067547 No, he will no longer reincarnate because he reached the goal in life in this world, in this material world is where you develop your devotion to God
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-068059-068182 Yeah
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-068077-068431 And to not get back to the spiritual world. And from the spiritual world, you can't come back to this material world to experience the cycle of birth, sickness, and death that all living things go through.
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-068465-068569 Exactly
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-069116-069406 Even the animals and humans are...
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-069135-069282 Ok,of course
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-069440-069508 No
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-069559-069903 Then he has already passed that level and he no longer reincarnates
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-070087-070201 None
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-070186-070506 Okay
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-070201-070548 He passed that level, he is already a pure devoted
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-070622-070862 Very interesting
20051010_212418_225_fsp-A-070927-071039 I don't know if it's very interesting
20051010_212418_225_fsp-B-071391-071926 How long have you been in this religion?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-000000-000375 Who's speaking?

20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-014743-015150 The cold in Cornell is brutal. The cold in Philadelphia can be endured, right? The cold in Cornell is too much.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-015175-015319 That is how it is.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-015175-015494 I don't know how you are going to know about that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-015475-015939 Yes. Wait a second, someone is knocking on the door. I have to open it. One moment, please.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-015695-015951 Yes, of course
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-023473-023962 About four minutes went by
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-023580-024125 Yes it doesn't matter
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-024075-024463 They never open when I want them to open
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-024444-024939 But but it seems to me that this program they have had several problems with the computers that or the, or I don't know with with the gadgets really that call
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-025221-025590 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-025503-025678 Twice I have been in the middle of the conversation and suddenly it cut out
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-026329-026780 To me like three I sent them an e-mail to this Shudong, Shudong
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-026805-027256 Shudong yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-027093-027413 And it answered me, and told me that there were several people with that.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-027701-027826 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-027732-028108 Another e-mail came from her saying that they had told her there were participants who don't speak Spanish very well
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-028622-028778 Yes those
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-028709-029148 When can we hang out?

20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-029235-029329 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-029323-029686 Yes Shudong tells you just hang up but that is embarrassing but I don't know.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-029843-030150 I've talked to one lady twice from New York that doesn't speak much Spanish, and I laugh a lot because
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-030673-030863 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-030958-031315 Her name is Erdestina, have you talked to her?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-031333-031542 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-031334-031453 Ernestina and since I'm Josefina, we laugh
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-031771-031898 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-031791-032091 And I tell her Ernestina, Josefina and then
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-032215-032368 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-032260-032680 We laugh a little and she tells me about her family
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-032806-033028 Is she American?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-033075-033275 I spoke to someone that lives in her house, and they told me she was from an island.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-034033-034321 Is not Grenada
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-034546-034685 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-034597-034822 From the Caribbean that has a special language and, something like that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-035136-035333 Not necessarily Spanish
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-035348-035718 Yes, but regardless she understands, well yes if one
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-035726-035904 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-035730-036118 If you explain it well she understands, look and this about the e-mail Have you bought? with You haven't requested?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-036380-036634 No, never. Well, what I have is in my account because I have two accounts. One is Hotmail and another in
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-037231-037542 In the university they hardly ever send me
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-037553-037678 No,
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-037574-037841 Like unsolicited mail; but in Hotmail it is terrible, all day I receive
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-037985-038160 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-038139-038501 Twenty-five messages that are all trash
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-038342-038693 That you won this, you put like they arrive via MSN. I have MSN.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-039047-039155 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-039144-039532 Then Josefina was rewarded with a free scholarship
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-039796-039904 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-039926-040221 And a trip and cruises and
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-040203-040393 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-040246-040615 I deleted them because those were known
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-040615-040761 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-040628-040897 If you answer not for
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-040825-041073 Yes. The sad thing is, because there are people who send all those e-mails, they create programs.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-042038-042120 They go through the internet from website to website then when they find
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-042494-042601 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-042704-042939 A bit of everything, what do you listen to?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-042933-043058 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-042958-043263 They put it on a list
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-043108-043471 They will find out so much about you.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-043434-043898 They also go to the news group
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-043496-043647 Such a weird people
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-043904-044273 To the all all all and then it is easy that for instance that the directories, or for instance the hotmail directory, I think that there too
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-044838-045187 They look for names, Then create a huge list.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-045175-045394 Wow
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-045200-045523 With that list they make a message right? and then they send it to everyone in the list, but the amount of work needed is so little right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-046177-046352 Mhm, mhm
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-046279-046507 And if two, or three people answer from the thousands they already earned enough money.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-047035-047273 To cover the expenses right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-047225-047600 Yes, that is sad.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-047367-047486 O but it is
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-047619-048152 With two or three fools they already molested all of us right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-047899-048325 That is horrible because I left it controlled by the filter downloading, I do not know. They installed a spam filter.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-049307-049384 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-049346-049728 I asked for it and didn't buy it, but they installed it!
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-049739-049853 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-049816-050204 I believe that filters a little but not always the junk where it says junk this appears, like ten or twelve a day right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-050355-050539 Yes, it always happens that if I read an article that looked interesting to me, that what Microsoft what wants to do now, is that it is making something like that, a software that does that
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-051784-052139 One time I sent a message to the computer and something that I don't know broke the code
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-053028-053174 Very large
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-053129-053242 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-053180-053606 But it will require a little work.  Really? Then if one is sending an email or have someone write one and I send it, no one will notice?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-053931-054037 So
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-053980-054088 And when the computer does the task, then exactly breaks the code, then Microsoft will give you a certificate via e-mail.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-055136-055542 The person took a little of time to make that. right? if only one is sending 2 e-mails it does not matter, the e mail will arrive and will know that is not spam
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-056336-056448 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-056406-056736 Do not have computer. Don't have the strength like this processor. Can't make it work. Right?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-057175-057263 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-057250-057517 This is to protect
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-058190-058501 Slow and they wont be able to send all the e mails that are being sent now a day.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-058496-058603 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-058520-058723 At the moment, when some one receive an e mail without the certificate, one knows that is a spam it can be thrown away.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-059179-059498 Or it needs to bring like a file or attachment or something like this
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-059765-060000 I don't know exactly
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-059862-060156 You want to open this e mail
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-060057-060412 I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I think it's a good idea.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-060532-060613 They made it to me because I have one email with Yahoo.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-061295-061358 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-061515-061609 When I try to send an email in Yahoo it asks me to decode something.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-062698-062787 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-062749-062974 Saying that I wasn't supposed to sit down for long periods of time because, because I'm sick and I can't sit down that long, I can't walk long periods of time, nor be standing for long periods of time either.
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-062977-063149 Yes

20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-063764-064102 But sometimes, it is a PRJ.

20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-065361-065530 To protect
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-065549-065847 But I think that the filters were not too efficient right? because if you think that each time that you can say well if I have
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-066984-067422 What is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-067584-067697 Yes
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-067739-068088 Who believes in the spam they know which one are the phrases that in general activate the filters right
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-068837-069050 None
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-068901-069193 They believe the message is the form that no
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-069576-069739 Not filter
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-069606-069911 That won't pick up the filter, yes then
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-069832-070070 Ah. And had you thought, in the forums like the Univision or Telemundo?
20051016_180547_265_fsp-B-070647-070888 Yes once and a while
20051016_180547_265_fsp-A-070753-071210 When you write a work like stupid or idiot it won't be collected?

20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-005014-005181 When it arrives
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-005322-005529 I don't like it when I open my email and see too many messages.
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-006176-006379 It makes my nerves
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-006409-006737 Nine messages and I want to see who has written
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-006763-006828 Yes
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-007096-007283 They are trash
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-007288-007354 The email is a scandal, the spam
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-007799-008330 Yes but the good thing is that for example, the service I use for mail
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-008340-008491 Which one do you use? Yahoo?
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-008375-008486 I use gmail.

20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-012601-012955 I believe that most of the services of technical email now because it is like an invasion they try in any way to put
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-013961-014057 Words like it was a conversation, and it is not only in Englih because I'm going to tell you that

20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-016478-016857 In Spain it is the same, there doesn't matter the language
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-017433-017767 Bad things get to anywhere in no time,
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-017807-018293 Then you never have bought nothing from a spam
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-018197-018252 You know that I have bought books, tickets and all kind of things from internet because of my own initiative
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-019344-019652 If I want to buy a book or I want to buy some CD or I want to buy some ticket for a concert or to the movies or whatever
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-020087-020294 But that's it, because I wanted. I have never bought it because I received spam
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-021068-021169 When I receive something in my mail that I have not asked for,I send it to the trash directly,I don't even read it
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-021887-022023 Have you bought something?
20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-023049-023317 I remember that maybe one year ago I  read an article in the newspaper about a man that

20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-024556-024945 That he lives off of that, but I have never met someone that

20051016_210626_267_fsp-B-025435-025627 That has bought from spam because it makes everyone angry when they see that blessed spam like this.
20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-026057-026390 The greatest part of these things are that they sell you things of, they take your money

20051016_210626_267_fsp-A-054363-054753 Insulting you and telling you that assistance arrives is like treating you badly as it is not your fault because I was the last monkey.

20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-011390-011636 Even the wildest animal is like that
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-012186-012539 Uh, um.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-012207-012452 And I also work in the court. So when I'm not in the court arguing something, I'm at the house. And, in those moments when you feel the most agitated
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-013109-013179 See comment
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-013138-013445 It's the best moment to turn on the radio. And hear something to calm you and to put you back in the
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-013462-013527 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-013808-014037 In the mode of thinking of what should be. I don't have kids yet but I lasted several years working in a day care
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-014889-014979 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-014952-015038 And that was the best, when one wanted to
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-015131-015262 Hm mm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-015317-015746 One class of eighteen four year olds to calm down
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-015539-015842 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-015746-016176 Put some classical music
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-016265-016890 We
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-016335-016603 And it seems to change, the entire more of the room. Because, it affects the sound of the human animal, like they say
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-017394-017647 Well we had a
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-017410-017490 So
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-017687-017919 Not a bad time, but my daughter, two months ago that she started to sleep during the nights, entirely
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-018398-018600 Okay.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-018554-018640 But when she was seven or eight years old we would take her from our bed
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-019013-019129 No.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-019099-019421 I had difficulty putting her to sleep and finally found out that music, with a sound machine
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-020258-020465 Hm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-020354-020803 She sleeps well. And now, we bought her an iPod
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-020768-021075 Okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-020984-021615 Because I have a month and a hundred or more CDs
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-021579-021715 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-021650-021857 I can select whatever I want her to listen. Normally when we send her to sleep
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-022078-022285 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-022240-022653 The songs of cradle...
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-022613-022739 Ya
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-022694-022850 I put some music, turn on the sound machine
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-023324-023440 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-023415-023884 So we read her some books. And when she hears that, she goes to sleep by herself. She sleeps better. I then put her to sleep in the cradle, and in five minutes, it's done
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-024433-024821 She knows the routine.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-024549-024665 Sleeping, yes, for that reason we bought the iPod.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-025290-025411 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-025366-025588 She wants to have more than five hundred CDs in the car
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-026233-026433 Yes, is better bringing the iPod that
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-026586-026636 And then she's like, someday,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-027302-027423 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-027368-027660 Then we bought the iPod with the money that she
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-027630-027776 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-027665-027857 She was my high school sweetheart.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-027811-027897 Right
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-027877-028174 She worked in
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-028089-028447 So it's more or less like her vagrancy, what you did
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-028346-028502 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-028447-028599 That's a good idea.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-028563-028658 We did it. Well, it was partly hers and partly mine, because I have my music there, too. So, you know,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-029060-029171 It's not going to be only her music.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-029178-029263 Yes. So
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-029366-029659 No, it's not like that
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-029510-029823 Probably ninety five percent hers.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-029803-029944 All
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-029863-030221 That is why we are in this place.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-030463-030559 Uh um.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-030508-030740 I has an earphone
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-030685-030806 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-030766-031466 When we bought it, I thought, who's gonna put a Walkman? that's what I'm doing now.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-031430-031701 No, that's the best. Because I'm telling you the point of view of a person that was a teacher.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-032047-032364 Yes, me too.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-032147-032505 They cultivate their love for music, and teaching them to read.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-033308-033588 Because it helps them with concentration, with the movements, if one observes kids sometimes when they listen to piano music,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-034238-034375 With their little fingers as if they were playing piano. All of that helps,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-034593-034689 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-034797-034934 I forgot how to say development in Spanish
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-035026-035102 I understood, don't worry
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-035349-035572 You're working marvels for the development of the child.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-036721-036860 There are certain things that you may think are a bit crazy. I was telling him that I want
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-037068-037159 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-037271-037635 I want to give birth in a bath
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-037729-038147 We are going to have our next baby,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-037981-038228 Hm mm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-038157-038258 In a week.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-038430-038742 Oh, wow.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-038521-038601 We're going to a maternity center that we have here
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-039055-039146 Yeah
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-039277-039373 My first one was a C-section.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-039620-039736 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-039715-039877 No, and it wasn't because I wanted to. It was supposedly for an emergency.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-040129-040779 Oh, Ok.  Sh quiet.  Sorry, it's the dog.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-040194-040477 Okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-040779-040936 I'm sorry
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-040900-041016 That's okay.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-041219-041429 Uh huh.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-041268-041863 She doesn't watch any TV.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-041813-042090 That's best
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-041919-042025 Ftentimes when we go to church, and they teach her with the little Elmo dolls
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-042398-042675 Hm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-042549-042831 She just looks at me like what's that. how does she not know who Elmo is, and I say, well we don't watch TV
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-043332-043794 That's the best method to assure the success of the child. To keep all that away from him. That's the problem with my husband.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-044523-044705 I tell him, because his mom was a little strange because he was always right in front of the TV.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-045231-045337 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-045267-045393 I don't know if I even had a TV until I was thirteen years old. My mom and dad never bought a TV, we didn't have any of that. So he finds it strange
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-046366-046436 In the school system I was always ahead, I finished college early, he was waiting on me. Everything I've done, I've done it quickly.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-047490-047813 And easily. And I always tell him it was because I didn't have all the distractions. I didn't have a TV to take an hour or two
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-048589-048690 One of us wanted to play music and my mom and dad would do what they could to take us for music lessons.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-050036-050278 If we were interested in animals we'd go to a museum
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-050445-050556 Yea.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-050495-050657 On the weekends, there was always something educational. So you grow up little by little, when you're, a teenager,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-051473-051952 You grow up and you see the difference, and from your friendships you know about all that.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-051655-052008 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-051952-052276 Now I that am mature, I always tell my mom and dad, 'thank you so much'.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-052966-053284 I can buy all the things I want. If I want an iPod, I can buy one. I have one.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-053319-053435 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-053354-053732 If I want a PlayStation, we have one here, but mostly it's just there picking up dust!
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-053813-054115 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-053919-054196 Because we never use it. I'm not interested and my husband says, if you are not sitting down to play with that thing, I won't play with it either.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-054519-054610 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-054564-054731 I also see the benefit of not wasting my youth away
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-055280-055406 Also, since we are having a baby, I was thinking that we shouldn't let her
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-055653-055734 Hm mm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-055860-056278 I was looking for an educational show that I could let her watch
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-056485-056858 Well, there are many shows nowadays.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-056848-057181 But still I couldn't.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-056858-057045 Two have the approval of the school system
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-058109-058210 Yes
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-058139-058265 In New York
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-058215-058608 I know that I won't have a problem getting her interested in television.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-059001-059107 0
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-059067-059218 And I rather try until she's around three or four years old,
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-059324-059586 Hm mm
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-059571-059959 She continues with her love for books and music. I prefer that we continue with that.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-060363-060645 No
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-060524-060857 I'll feel that for me to be able to have a little bit of time
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-061295-061860 The most I'll do, if I do it, will be half and hour a day, and it's going to be a program that I know that
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-061603-061673 Yeah.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-061865-062057 It's educational.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-061986-062319 I don't know you, but I trust that you will do a wonderful job because of the way I hear you talking
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-062687-063050 Is everything that, in my mind this is what I want to do This is what I want to see and when I talk to my husband
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-063423-063484 I don't know But
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-063584-063801 But
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-063731-064048 I'm listening and I realize that he is good, you know all you say is perfect.there's nothing
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-064588-064794 That I would do different, so to speak.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-064784-065379 The biggest problem we have is that we don't watch much TV
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-065324-065455 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-065410-065843 If you come inside our house, you'd think we watch a lot of tv, because our house came with
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-066090-066226 Came with those, fifty-two inch televisions.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-066373-066731 Oh my goodness!
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-066579-066993 Last Christmas, we bought a TiVO.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-066968-067119 Okay.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-067058-067295 We recorded those old movies and or programs that we are interested
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-067386-067482 No comment.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-067744-067971 But it is nothing. We never see ABC, NBC, or any of those.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-068092-068319 Yes, that's the best
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-068223-068621 It is always the Discovery Channel or the History Channel
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-068480-068707 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-068652-069020 But because of that reason, my husband is watching least television,because I don't want her to see telivision.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-069337-069463 Yes.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-069342-069650 Because when he is in the house, she is awake.we don't turn it on.
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-069831-070119 Oh okay
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-069973-070310 That was one of the difficulties we still have,he understands that I don't want her to watch television
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-070744-071031 If He is watching?, then she is watching
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-071036-071142 Is giving her permission
20051017_180712_270_fsp-A-071268-071389 None
20051017_180712_270_fsp-B-071319-071626 That is the problem I have with mine. I don't watch television. I am always in the room.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-000030-000096 Hello.

20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-002603-002714 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-002673-002830 Why did they take her to eat
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-002795-002916 Is it in the house or still in the hospital?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-003265-003720 The next day we left the hospital, after it was born.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-003659-003826 How good.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-003801-003978 We were only there twenty four hours.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-004453-004594 He awakes every two hours
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-005428-005514 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-005489-005610 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-005716-005919 Every two hours we must feed him.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-005898-006035 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-005919-006212 Well they are nursing him.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-006490-006561 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-006561-006889 So you don't have to worry about giving him formula or anything.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-007081-007203 Well, it's not your turn to awake.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-007349-007425 It's okay. No. That? Nothing. One or two times he awakes but only to be with them.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-008325-008446 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-008643-008785 That is how it is done.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-008931-009245 Speak with Jenny
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-009250-009346 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-009285-009513 I also spoke with your brother but I forgot his name.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-009705-009841 Yes?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-009765-010008 Because, he began to do it. To study as well. Because, Jenny stopped participating.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-010726-010948 How come you have told me nothing about it?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-010908-011256 Yes, that's what he told me when I spoke. Because, notice that I spoke two times, I need it to speak to a lady from New York.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-011792-012298 And she did speak a little Spanish; but, she did not speak it very good.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-012333-012495 Hurray.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-012490-013051 I send a e mail to the person of the studio, and I asked what will happened
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-013501-013597 Yeah.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-013531-013693 And he told me to hang up quick, it will end the call, because it will not charge that call.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-014274-014461 Okay.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-014299-014830 Then, he sent an e mail to everybody in the world, saying that yes you speak with someone that don't speak good English and the spanish.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-015189-015411 Do not talk to that person.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-015396-015654 Yes, I also receive one e mail from them.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-015664-015730 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-015775-016377 Your brother told me that Jenny read that message and then decided not to participate anymore.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-016675-016943 Yes, I didn't say that I was stopping participation.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-017555-017732 That it was thinking it was for her.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-017716-017797 Ah, aha.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-017787-017878 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-017797-018353 No. No.  I told your brother I was the one who sent that e-mail.  I did not send it for her.  It was said by the other lady who spoke no Spanish except for little words that she was able to say.

20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-022685-022786 All of them in Spanish. I asked her, Jenny why would you have music in Spanish? Why don't you have music in English? She said, I like music in Spanish only. I don't like music in English.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-023762-023893 None

20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-029120-029464 Since there aren't many hispanics, and he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no hispanics, he's the only Hispanic

20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-057048-057406 Is the music that we have here inside the music player. Then, it is good because it wakes you little by little.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-057760-057882 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-057816-057907 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-058170-058599 Are you going to clubs in Texas?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-058700-059074 When you get to Houston you should expect to go salsa dancing often.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-059246-059317 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-059337-059747 Yes, I encountered a group of people there where I go to school, that dance salsa and go out often. But, now no. Now I don't have time to go out anywhere.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-060399-060459 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-060510-060707 I became tired on going out because I've already been to the same places and seen the same people.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-061582-061976 Always, the places were but too full of people. Then, I want to dance, and if I could almost not dance, and the people stepped on you or strike you when they are circling. Then, I was already tired of that.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-062047-062107 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-063027-063376 Besides that, you have to pay a lot to get into those places.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-063462-063629 That's right
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-063492-063786 I go out, but I'd rather go to a quiet place
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-064665-064756 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-064756-065009 Where you just sit and talk
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-064913-065297 We have a dance salon in here. Mexican groups come and play.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-065272-065347 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-065347-065519 Northern music, and stuff like that.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-065499-065605 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-065575-065878 You won't believe this, it costs around fifty dollars to get in.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-065812-066444 Wow. But why? Do they bring well-known groups or what?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-065974-066055 Yes, groups. Still, some people are not lucky enough to get tickets. Some don't get in.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-066717-066828 Wow. But that's because you live in a very big city.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-067344-067405 Yes.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-067410-067491 So,
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-067516-067839 It is a nice place but I did not like it.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-067809-067885 None
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-067839-067981 You can't even walk in there!
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-068138-068360 Yes and no. That's the problem, yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-068401-068623 They are good groups from Mexico,
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-068977-069037 Of course.
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-069073-069528 The ball has a capacity of 4000 people, which are the ones who get in. I only went there once, and I really didn't like it
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-070180-070336 Yes
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-070261-070473 I don't go out that much, too many problems, you go out and
20051017_220530_275_fsp-A-071155-071221 Hello?
20051017_220530_275_fsp-B-071256-071413 I think the call dropped.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-004210-004342 Puerto Rico
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-004301-004382 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-004392-004453 And How long have you been here?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-004397-004589 I have been living in Chicago for the past thirty years
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-004751-004928 Long time
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-004903-005029 And you?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-005029-005287 I have been living here for ten years
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-005398-005545 Wow
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-005555-005838 Not so long yet, but seems a lot. Right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-005807-005929 Isn't it cold there?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-005994-006323 It has started getting cold, but it is not like Chicago
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-006313-006515 Yes, here in Chicago is very cold
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-006520-006596 That's right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-006525-006682 Specially the snow
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-006702-007026 I heard that is terrible.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-006990-007056 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-007051-007294 My brother-in-law lives in Chicago, too.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-007258-007445 Oh, yeah? In which part?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-007354-007415 I didn't see where they lived, but he goes to the University of Chicago
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-007971-008087 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-008057-008208 I think they live nearby; I think over the University apartments,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-008486-008648 Ok
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-008628-008754 So I don't know
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-008689-008941 You know today's subject, right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-008941-009073 Yeah, the music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-009073-009169 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-009098-009376 What music? Being from Puerto Rico, what music do you like?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-009417-009513 I like very much Bachata music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-009735-009912 What's Bachata?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-009821-009877 It's soft music
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-010311-010387 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-010392-010529 When they sing that music it's, and Alejandra, Alex, well. CD's at the library
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-011418-011524 Yeah.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-011469-011646 To listen to them. I also like Reggae. I don't know if you listen to Reggaeton, which is trending now.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-012181-012409 I have heard something, yes.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-012348-012500 Of Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Tego Calder, Ivy Queen
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-012889-013081 So living in Chicago, didn't you struggle to maintain the music you listened back at Puerto Rico?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-013617-013769 No, almost
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-013693-013784 Because a lot
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-013779-013900 It's almost the same.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-013905-014138 There is a lot of variety in Chicago
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-014224-014390 All
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-014365-014608 Did you miss that a lot?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-014532-014653 No because back then
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-014679-014764 That's great!
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-014800-015058 Back at Puerto Rico, I listened to the Boleros and Salsa, but I don't really like Boleros nor Salsa because they aren't danceable.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-015725-015831 I see.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-015882-015957 They're more romantic.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-016129-016210 I see.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-016165-016488 But we use a lot the Merengue
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-016513-016584 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-016574-016802 That, like Olga TaÃ±on and Elvis Crespo.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-016877-017014 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-016943-017226 Here in Chicago they do a lot of  Puerto Rican parades.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-017418-017560 So great.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-017433-017570 And they were invited. This year came Ivi Queen which is the Babe of Reggeaton.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-018429-018611 In two thousand four Elvis came
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-018429-018520 What
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-018621-018712 Crespo.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-018712-018879 Really?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-018859-018960 Yes, then
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-018889-019112 Yes,here in Idaho, nobody comes, then.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-019061-019172 No.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-019127-019304 No.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-019218-019455 Here we also have a Boricua party
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-020330-020537 That is so awesome.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-020380-020527 And they are free
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-021199-021275 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-021235-021568 They take lots of music from Colombia, from mexico, from all parts of Puerto rico and then world
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-021851-022114 Then you don't feel as far from where you come from.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-022225-022382 A ha
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-022301-022407 There is all that,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-022397-022513 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-022407-022660 There is nothing here in Idaho. Here the only music is like Mexican.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-023135-023262 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-023226-023454 I don't know what's it's called, but it's like skippy, or I don't know how.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-023636-023727 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-023686-024025 It's music that I haven't heard in Chile
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-023989-024111 No
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-024065-024146 And of course, there in Chile you listen to music more like, boleros too and
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-024778-024874 Right
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-024828-024935 But of course you miss it here, you don't hear much of that. And no one comes here either. So you don't have.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-025799-025839 True
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-025809-025946 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-025839-025961 Concerts or any of that. I missed it so much that Im now listening to satellite radio.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-026497-026593 Right.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-026572-026840 I have been able to remember many songs in Spanish
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-027487-027654 Stuff like Reggaeton.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-027598-027720 Correct.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-027725-028079 I had no idea about that, because it's been ten years since I listened to music in Spanish.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-028104-028316 Because now here in Chicago we have a station that is nine hundred three point one FM.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-028867-029029 And it's music in Spanish.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-028913-029064 All day long regaaeton plays on there.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-029236-029393 Oh, sweet!
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-029368-029727 Right, especially when you're driving in your car.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-029727-029802 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-029757-029929 That you don't get bored when you put on the radio on high and the travels seem
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-030394-030510 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-030414-030535 Quick, and you don't get bored, you can't fall asleep in the car or anything
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-030828-030985 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-030909-031031 Listening to music.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-031076-031496 Yes it's good having music in Spanish because
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-031486-031551 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-031536-031829 Because in English it's good but it's not the same
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-031784-031900 No, No
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-031834-031951 It's not what we've been raised with

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-032158-032390 Currently, I'm happy with listening to music in Spanish once again, because it really makes a difference
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-032795-032891 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-032886-033048 In my mood
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-033053-033406 I don't know if you're listening to the music when one waits for another person
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-033775-033947 I got the phone to speak, that music I don't like because it's classic and it's when you go
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-034655-034781 Looking ot see that
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-034781-034973 When you go on an elevator
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-034978-035120 Of course

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-035347-035428 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-035368-035600 It's not beautiful, and they should change it to Merengue or Bachata music
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-035959-036141 Of course
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-036010-036055 Cumbias are beautiful
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-036404-036571 More animated, right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-036545-036682 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-036616-036793 At least you can dance
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-037026-037182 No, you go to sleep waiting
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-037460-037551 Yes

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-038335-038456 Aha. The other time, I was waiting half an hour. And when I went to communicate with someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven at night.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-039341-039558 They already hung up on calls
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-039558-039659 Seriously?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-039644-039780 None

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-041863-041974 To anyone you like.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-041974-042252 You can talk more of once a day?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-042217-042429 Just once.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-042283-042394 Once a day.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-042444-042495 Yes.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-042545-042692 Yes, the other time that I talk, I speak with my sister, because we call at the same time.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-044304-044456 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-044355-044562 Then when she did the recording, we could hear her and speak with her. That was the only time that I speak, because from there I don't speak more
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-045219-045341 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-045326-045411 So, this is me first time talking with someone else.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-045457-045543 Good Lord! You are missing a lot, twenty three
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-045952-046139 I got my act together, and that is why I called. I was waiting for someone to call me, but nothing happened.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-046427-046503 Because the last time they put it for politics.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-046786-046887 Yes
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-046802-047034 I called and no one picked up the phone.  No one did it.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-047352-047570 It scares. Is it not?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-047388-047454 I receive calls each afternoon at 5 pm.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-048166-048288 Ok
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-048323-048545 That if I want to pick up the phone to talk, but I do not pick up the phone because I do not know what they are talking about.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-049081-049192 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-049122-049283 How is the music? This is the second time that I'm talking.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-051048-051235 I spoke too.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-051280-051563 I do not like to talk about politics and migrations because

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-052387-052463 Yes.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-052417-052695 About cell phones, I only have nine left to go thanks god.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-053074-053403 And after twenty something calls, you don't have to call anymore right?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-053347-053560 After twenty five calls, you wait two or three months, they then send you a cheque.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-053868-054010 That's good
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-053979-054055 Yes

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-055016-055091 Of course.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-055031-055177 You have to call, communicate. But it has to be after five in the evening, that's the time they change the.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-055759-055870 What's the theme of what they're talking about?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-056112-056213 And is everyday different?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-056436-056689 Well, last time, I talked about five times referencing marketing.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-057133-057295 Five consecutive days.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-057214-057315 I talked for about an hour. Two music, three marriage, once with cellphones. There are lots of themes.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-058155-058271 None

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-059029-059272 But first, you had to talk about a lot of topics. Almost always, they were the same topics, so people can talk
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-060010-060090 Sure
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-060116-060257 Look then
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-060141-060202 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-060288-060439 When you are driving do you listen to music?
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-060717-060773 I do, I listened music too but there was a lot of time that I stopped listening music and I started listening
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-061698-061799 Problems, conversation programs

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-063007-063113 I understand
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-063088-063235 The music really changes your mood.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-063710-063765 None

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-063952-064215 I started listening to music to have a better mood
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-064412-064478 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-064483-064574 I'm not sure, but it could be our Latin blood.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-067005-067167 I like everything now.
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-067137-067238 Yeah,
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-067172-067400 Before, when I was in Chile I did not like salsa, merengue or anything like that. Now that I am here, I love it.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-069538-069659 Yeah
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-069624-069735 Most ones here are like unique, they are Mexicans
20051017_234550_276_fsp-B-069892-069978 None
20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-069937-070038 On TV, on the radio, there is nothing Spanish, nothing Latino.

20051017_234550_276_fsp-A-071681-071939 Boring; when I went to California to visit I was to-
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-000007-000536 Betsy, hello. How are you?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-000095-000932 One time yes I am Tammy again
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-000660-001138 Here sitting, seeing what you can tell me about social assistance or whatever because I have no idea
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-001454-002247 Well, I think that some things are good but others are not.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-002269-002651 Aha
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-002313-002966 Especially the one for older people. They don't give them enough money or it is not because of the money but that they need medical help. The pills are not completely covered
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-003701-003804 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-003796-004634 It is more difficult for them to take their pills becuase of the fact they have to pay for them and also  have to eat.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-004626-004979 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-004692-005346 I know people well so have been abused

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-005941-006514 Of those uses that real people, that other people really need
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-006462-006558 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-006624-007219 It's difficult because my mother is a wedge between my husband and I.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-007175-007623 Aha
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-007241-007740 And she is partially on assistance. They don't help her much. She has to search for coupons so she can buy medicine.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-008541-008856 To buy a medication this month or another medication next month.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-008856-009238 That's ugly
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-008944-009422 Because he cannot have all of them and that is bad because if you don't take things as you are supposed to take them.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-009414-009664 No
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-009458-009877 You are scared, because they will not help you.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-009818-010318 This is the welfare or pension

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-010435-011258 I can imagine
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-010575-011155 Assistance that is given to them is hard to get, and you have to show that your need is real.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-011845-012543 You have this and if you do what it takes to get it, you have to be working
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-012543-012660 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-012646-013461 If you do not know they do not pay you well, but they pay you a little more than twenty dollars from the
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-013020-013145 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-013483-014004 The limit they give you does not help, because it's less than twenty dollars.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-014085-014173 Yeah
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-014107-014563 It is twenty dollars over the limit, which is not a lot.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-014570-014665 Yeah
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-014599-014878 They prefer that you do not work.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-014900-015025 I see
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-014988-015569 They will help you, but it's not enough to survive.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-015547-016090 But they don't pay you, let's say, for all the medicine you need?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-015906-016406 They are giving you something but they can't. They don't want to help you.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-016281-016707 None
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-016421-017133 They don't want to help you because you do a lot, supposedly, and a lot isn't enough. You can't survive on this, and you have to work so that you can make enough for them to help you.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-017375-017853 And what they help you with is not enough. There are many ways anyway
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-017507-018161 Not that much, it is hard mija. It is very hard for persons to try and do that and  believe that is why some people work under the table
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-018602-018829 Yeah
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-018697-019079 They can not say that they are working because they will not help them and they have children
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-019571-020298 But after the eighteen years they no longer help. when your children have there eighteen years they will no longer help
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-019931-020482 No, that is why I was seeing my son that crazy comes to my home and tells me, Hey mom so why do you not want to apply to the government for them to give me lunches.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-024829-025380 That miracle that when my son moved, he found an apartment close to us, and it was seven hundred twenty five a month and that is cheap
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-025769-026078 But does not include utilities
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-026093-026746 No that do not include nothing them you can imagine with two
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-026298-026768 Ohay, more expensive
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-026783-027569 If a person has four people in the house and it has been twenty and four thousand
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-027275-027686 It is not enough
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-027716-028399 Because of that, I always tell my children to be careful, work, take care of your credit and save your money
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-028700-029324 They don't spend it on things that they don't need

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-032746-033356 Yes.  It is very bad that this man got liek that.  When he called me mom I told him I support him and to come over.  I will convince him that he can go to school because
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-033671-033804 He was not working when he moved with his girlfriend.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-034450-035294 The people from work said he can go to the school in the morning.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-035331-036044 They will help him to work after that.  I told him if you go to school I will not chare you rent.

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-036117-036543 If you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because I want him to finish school

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-044761-045510 During a few months from there, because we went to the school and from there my parents got a job and my brother and I were in high school
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-045892-046685 Because my parents were working they helped us because my brother was fifteen

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-048242-048638 Yes but they put me on welfare sometimes before, but I though that here they would help you a little because they give you a card for medicine

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-049299-050093 He had to present it at the store where he will buy the medicine and they will pay well. They paid well last time I asked for assistance.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-050988-051547 But now I do not know how it will be, it should be more difficult
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-051591-052303 My husband was in the Air Force when he came from
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-052303-052641 Aha!

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-053691-054286 It took him one month to find work.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-054315-054484 Great
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-054337-054998 He found a job within a month.  The next paycheck then took us a month out.  We came out one time from seeing him.  We came out once from seeing him but when one goes to the store, they are like fake papers.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-055799-055938 For real?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-055843-056350 The people they, when you go out shopping and that was years ago, so today I believe they give you a card

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-057965-058053 That is true
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-058560-059037 I told my husband never again.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-059037-059155 No
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-059059-059720 I work whenever before I would get into that and has told me that under I do not put my family like that
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-059757-059853 No
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-059831-060433 So that because it is how they look at you bad I say no man because you are asking for a little help
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-060146-060543 Like
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-060455-060837 Because things didn't turn out well or it is very difficult.
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-060947-061659 Already they for sure, they the same thing happened to them and they give you a dirty look it is like that

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-063062-063525 So I say
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-063194-063987 Why look bad at people who get govermental help?
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-063767-064465 They are not stealing.  They did not just go crazy and start.  They are

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-064817-064927 What it was like a little paper that said the government would help and the people knew

20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-066154-066837 It's not money and they don't send you a check for yoour house or into your account

20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-068474-069172 And it was like five dollars, twenty dollars and you had to take it out of there and give it to the person and they didn't give you change
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-069172-069326 Oh no
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-069238-070061 It's like you had to try to be adequate
20051018_210220_279_fsp-B-069848-070421 The government would do it to make you ashamed
20051018_210220_279_fsp-A-070384-070949 And so had to be sure that you didn't use it for alcohol such that looks bad and so I think now with the card it is better

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-016372-016675 She's travelled so many times on plane

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-017413-017489 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-017464-017752 She gives a lot of work?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-018303-018798 She has her moments when she doesn't listen to what I tell her
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-019061-019162 But
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-019122-019233 Yeah
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-019167-019299 When I talk to her and I asked her to do something, she does it. Because I make sure that she does it.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-019956-020102 Yeah
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-020047-020193 Because I want for her to behave good.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-020416-020714 That's good.

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-020855-021214 Sending so many e mails, then it will delay more and possibly what is waiting is going to delay so much that I believe it will be too much.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-021386-021649 Oh, boy. And you live with another person
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-022134-022306 Yes, with my husband.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-022139-022251 Another.  Your Husband, is  that it?

20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-022660-022978 You have one husband and one daughter, correct?

20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-024090-024136 You don't know.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-024722-025021 The only thing we want is to be healthy

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-027614-027947 It was a very hot day even though the humidity was not too high.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-028089-028266 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-028190-028347 What does not affect much here is only the temperature.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-028670-028741 Yeah
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-028716-028827 We have about seventy to eighty percent humidity normally.

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-030136-030657 When you get out, you start to sweat. It's like someone hitting you with a wet blanket?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-030803-030985 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-030935-031127 Is very sticky

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-031379-031688 We are getting into the time of year, we feel hot, but the humidity goes down.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-032310-032486 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-032441-032785 I can wash my hair
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-032775-032866 Yeah,
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-032785-032850 I can be the whole night with my hair wet
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-033341-033462 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-033351-033543 I'm not parched because there's a lot of humidity.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-033664-033826 Boy
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-033740-034382 Especially if I wash it in the morning, and leave it in a little bun.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-034266-034362 Ah.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-034448-034665 The hair I've left wet the whole day
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-034675-034877 Wow.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-034857-035059 So, it's not the heat as much as the humidity.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-035479-035529 Yes.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-035610-035873 So it's still cold over there?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-035777-035969 It's cold maybe sixty degrees
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-036465-036540 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-036530-036960 Yes, it's cold today. It's very cold.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-037713-037986 And when you normally have snow
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-038380-038451 What?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-038451-038876 When it begins to snow
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-038931-039103 Maybe the other day. The other day was seventy, but today, it's very cold. And every day is.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-041120-041484 The change, it changed a lot. Maybe today is sixty, tomorrow fifty, you know, so.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-042429-042576 But, When does it begin to snow?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-042980-043076 I don't know. I don't know.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-043460-043733 I thought that it snowed in New York.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-043809-044011 In New York, who?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-044294-044491 Didn't you tell me you were in New York?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-044638-044714 Yes

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-045492-045897 Okay, no. I thought that it snowed in New York, that's why I was asking you.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-046377-046589 Talk too fast
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-046564-046695 I'm sorry.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-046614-047044 Where,you are from Honduras?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-047529-047656 My parents are from Dominican Republic.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-048121-048298 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-048197-048379 I was born in Puerto Rico.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-048363-048697 Is your mother dominican?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-048864-048990 My father too.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-048985-049283 There are a lot of Dominicans in New York.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-049723-049920 And Puerto Ricans too.

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-050497-050562 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-050633-051053 There are very poor people in the Bronx.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-051993-052362 It has dark skinned people, dominicans and mexicans
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-052847-052918 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-052887-053332 In the Bronx, Puerto Ricans and Haitians

20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-055076-055192 People are very poor. They don't have a lot of money, here in the Bronx. Do you have a lot of money?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-056567-056704 I don't think so. I mean, we have a house, but my husband is the only one who works. And we have to
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-057133-057250 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-057341-057593 No, we don't have a luxurious life
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-057578-057679 Yeah
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-057649-057720 We have enough money to buy what we need
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-058367-058529 Yeah
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-058417-058791 Pay the electric bill. But we don't have anything to go on vacation.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-059125-059201 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-059312-059509 We have what we need, however,
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-059550-059615 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-059646-060146 We only have one care
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-060161-060242 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-060171-060303 Two cars.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-060358-060641 You don't have two cars?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-060581-060652 No, we have one car.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-060864-061228 Do you live in small or a big house?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-061385-061577 No. We own a house. It's a pretty small house.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-061865-062006 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-061930-062143 We have three bedrooms.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-062173-062310 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-062213-062441 And two bathrooms. It's not big. And around here, some of the houses are very expensive
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-062835-063073 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-063088-063295 I'm telling you, we have what we need.

20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-063609-063796 But, it's not a life of luxury.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-063836-063998 What ?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-063917-064402 And we are not starving. And no, we don't need more clothes.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-064392-064473 Yes.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-064458-064913 But as I am not working, I stay with my daughter
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-064867-064958 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-064948-065095 It makes us difficult
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-065312-065757 Is the clothing very expensive?
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-065772-065858 I think that, yes. Look, almost a year has passed since I've bought clothing. I buy my girls' clothes in a consignment shop.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-067036-067147 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-067167-067455 We save a lot of money, but I don't go shopping.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-067799-067875 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-067900-068072 Shopping because the clothing is too expensive.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-068304-068416 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-068421-068714 So then, we normally buy clothes, we go, from shops like Costcos
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-069017-069149 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-069058-069159 Something like that
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-069280-069376 Yes
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-069346-069700 If we find something that suits us and is good, then we buy it there.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-069760-069892 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-069780-070018 I don't do that.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-A-070463-070579 None
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-070650-070857 That thing doesn't matter to me. I have a lot of clothes, I don't care if it's branded.
20051018_210744_280_fsp-B-071504-071610 Whatever

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-007951-008087 It says I'm near
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-008052-008173 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-008244-008456 So, how do you say it? For travel? When you have time. I like to do it in the car, driving here.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-009078-009144 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-009154-009351 Because you stop and rest when you like it
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-009548-009649 Sure
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-009573-009821 With the family, you have to stop to rest.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-009775-009892 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-010084-010225 If you go on a bus, you are going to stop only once. And it's very uncomfortable.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-010685-010817 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-011029-011332 And thatâ€™s all
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-011287-011610 You only visited touristy places in Arizona.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-011914-012101 Grand Cannon

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-012631-012879 It's very nice, although it's very much like a desert zone
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-013026-013157 Of course, yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-013106-013465 But there are many beautiful things.

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-015578-015674 It's an industrial city
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-016726-016893 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-016771-016923 There are two, I don't know exactly what they are

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-017772-018045 They are very big waterfalls, very tall
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-017939-018020 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-018151-018545 Many people visit them from different places

20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-018591-018707 It's very nice
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-018818-018975 And would you like to go to any other country in the world?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-019192-019420 I want to go to Alaska.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-019390-019541 Alaska?

20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-019774-019976 There it's very cold.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-019885-020198 It is really cold.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-020188-020299 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-020254-020426 I would like to be there
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-020507-020673 Yes. The boss I had before went to Antarctica, the South Pole.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-021214-021310 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-021315-021482 Yes, to see the penguins, because the penguins are just at the south pole
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-021861-021993 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-021973-022094 And she loved it.  You can take cruises to Alaska from California nd then from Alaska to.....
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-022867-023110 I had known before
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-022903-023110 And then you get to see all glaciers and all the
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-023378-023716 Yes, I like enough to go to meet there
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-023646-023742 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-023762-024000 But sometimes, there is no time.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-023954-024090 Yes, no
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-024060-024176 When?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-024090-024267 It costs time and money
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-024181-024535 When you sometimes have the time you don't have money
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-024480-024591 Yes, it is difficult.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-024884-025041 Ths is what happens.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-025036-025147 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-025076-025208 How? Yes, tell me.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-025197-025364 You tell.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-025299-025617 What happens is that, I tell you, like when you have holidays, you, what is, that good, at least I try to
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-026213-026598 Go out to see my family
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-026421-026613 Right
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-026598-026820 Two or three years without seeing them
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-026780-026916 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-026876-027032 You have an opportunity but I prefer to see my family, taking walks, too, iI don't know
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-027755-027882 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-027775-027917 We are very united, we visit each other a lot.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-028114-028251 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-028200-028529 And that's good. You have times that are better to go out and see family.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-028741-028852 When you marry, it's  difficult to go see your family and go on holidays
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-029984-030272 Your wife or husband's family
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-030090-030414 That is another issue
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-030293-030631 Time is up and the vacation and money all goes there
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-031041-031415 Yes, actually time because I'll tell you that when you go see family I don't spend much like when you go to
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-031592-031743 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-031844-032138 I don't know that you go on a trip to see different cities or countries.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-032254-032345 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-032340-032739 You spend more there because of hotels and food expenses.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-032431-032613 Yes, of course.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-032805-033174 Wherever you go you are going to spend money
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-033164-033260 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-033189-033452 To visit family, you do spend money. I won't say that you don't, however,
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-033619-033705 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-033674-033826 You don't spend as much
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-033775-033877 Of course, yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-033871-034043 It is very different.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-034018-034099 I hope now that I started working as a nurse, and I start to have money that I'm able to travel.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-034978-035145 That's great
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-035009-035236 I have been to Europe and I have been in Costa Rica and Guatemala. I have been to Mexico, but only in Mexico City.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-036222-036540 In Puerto Vallarta and Chiapas.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-036520-036702 Oh, Yes?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-036581-036748 I was in San Cristobal where else was I in Chiapas? I don't remember. I was in in Taxco also, when I was
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-037946-038203 Taxco
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-038173-038385 I was in Mexico.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-038416-038593 On vacation?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-038416-038567 Yes, I have a friend that loves to travel and to stay long in other countries. She just got back from being abroad two years in
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-039786-039917 In Taiwan and when I ran into her in Mexico, she had been six months in Mexico and so she was touring the whole country
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-041095-041373 And I rant into her when I was in Chiapas
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-042156-042303 I returned, she stayed
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-042293-042510 Yes, I with the vacations.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-042303-042525 She is from Mexico City and she was studying
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-042712-042859 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-042717-042909 She was two years old there
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-044062-044219 How nice.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-044122-044421 Yes, when I did ten trips with her, I didn't spend hardly anything because we stayed at hostels
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-045614-045750 But, you can stay there.  You do have to sleep in a room with a lot of people.  But we did not pay anything.  We paid
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-046579-046827 Two dollars, or three dollar a night
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-046817-046973 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-046903-047105 But almost everyone is a student.  You have to share a room with people that you don't know but
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-047514-047903 At least you know you are not in danger with people.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-048060-048222 Yes, they are people that
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-048171-048318 These are
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-048222-048358 Who is doing the same as
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-048338-048616 People who are in the same
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-048358-048540 They come to travel, and they want to spend little money. I also went to Europe and I stayed a month
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-049718-050047 Traveling to Europe ended up being expensive, but my parents helped me because it was my present for graduating from the university. But that was after I was in Houston
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-050911-051164 I have only gone to Aruba, which is off the north coast of Venezuela.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-051619-051770 Okay.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-051730-051806 Yes, and that is an island like Puerto Rico but I didn't like it. It is a famous tourist site in the Caribbean but I didn't like it.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-052918-053171 Because Puerto Rico is also an island. Puerto Rico is a lot greener and Aruba is deserted, there is nothing.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-053964-054070 Absolutely nothing, the only thing is the beaches are beautiful but aside from the beaches, there is nothing to see
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-054813-055081 It's deserted there?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-055132-055309 In Aruba, yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-055263-055364 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-055349-055637 Yes, it is very dry there is absolutely nothing it's very flat and the only thing that there is is rocks, everything is very rocky and the
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-056234-056426 Beaches are also rocky
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-056416-056522 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-056441-056653 The sand is white and the water is very clear. You can see beyond the water, it is very clear blue.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-057336-057467 Notice.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-057341-057472 But no, there is nothing else to see absolutely nothing else
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-057917-058205 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-057967-058190 Like that so I didn't like it but that yes I am lucky that all my family is in Puerto Rico except a sister that I have who lives in Florida.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-059206-059433 All the rest are in Puerto Rico. But now, for example, I went to visit my sister in Florida. And then in August,
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-060192-060454 I TRAVELLED TO PUERTO RICO TO VISIT MY FAMILY IN DECEMBER AND I'AM GOING TO CANADA TO VISIT MY BOYFRIEND'S FAMILY
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-060849-061021 I don't have any time or money left to go anywhere else
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-061197-061420 That's right.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-061268-061405 Because I'd have made three trips, three flights, I have no money left to go anywhere else, so I think that when I finish school, I'm going to take some
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-062421-062855 Time off on holidays before I start again. I'm going to work to
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-062780-063012 Rest
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-062926-063164 Yes, or to go someplace where I want to go, a different place. Not just to visit family
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-063846-064099 Well, that's fine too. Because once you start working you don't know how your life is going to turn out since your whole life is going to change, right?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-064842-065024 Yes. Usually when you start working they don't let you take time off.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-065555-065661 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-065600-065716 I've heard of companies that tell you that you can't take time off during the first three months, you can't go on vacations, and some other companies say it's six months.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-066202-066368 You'll see.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-066278-066515 How is your baby doing?
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-066687-066925 Very well, thank you.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-066818-067010 Yes, getting bigger.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-067036-067319 Yes, he's fine, he's getting bigger, he was born on a Wednesday and we took her to the pediatrician on Saturday.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-067713-067814 Aha.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-068062-068350 She had gaind about a pound.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-068320-068411 None
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-068441-068744 The doctor told us that it's very good that she gained weight because many children
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-069371-069725 They're born, they usually tend to get a little thin
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-069664-069750 Uh, um.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-069765-070058 This girl didn't lose, on the contrary, she gained weight.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-070149-070205 Right
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-070205-070357 She'll be too on November the 18th
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-070301-070392 Right.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-070422-070786 I hope she keeps like that without having problems.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-070630-070721 Yes. At first, they grow so fast.
20051019_190221_288_fsp-B-071135-071297 Yes
20051019_190221_288_fsp-A-071135-071251 So fast. Until they're two. Then after that, they're still growing,
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-000000-000587 Betsy hello Alex.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-000075-000492 Betsy, you're talking to Alex again, how are you?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-000642-001113 Fine thanks, and you?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-000799-001045 Then the subject of the trips
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-001496-001769 Something interesting
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-001715-001906 Yes something interesting
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-001865-002316 Better that politics, than the politics o r whatever
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-002316-002658 I had a lot of different opinions.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-002610-002986 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-002692-003177 You want to start this time
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-003170-003498 If I had money, lots of it, I would like to go to Hawaii for at least two months.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-004592-004735 I would like to say something.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-004722-004886 For what?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-004858-005029 The grandmother of my husband says that it's beautiful and I would like to go on a cruise
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-006218-006567 Is you husband Canadian?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-006403-006717 Yes, he is.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-006717-006970 Yes a cruise would be fantastic
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-006888-007373 I have never been on a cruise before. Have you?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-007674-008063 Right I traveled one time to Spain
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-008050-008159 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-008097-008255 I liked Jibrartal and the southern part of Spain where the beaches are
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-008726-008931 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-008856-009109 Hey were very pretty landscapes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-009088-009211 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-009164-009526 But I didn't have the money to stay very long
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-009485-009587 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-009580-009956 And that always frustrated me and then if I would win a prize and I had the money
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-010476-010694 Yes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-010489-010927 When one has money one must have time
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-010865-010981 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-010981-011296 And then I would love to travel to Spain and visit the
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-011466-011583 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-011733-012102 There are many castles and interesting things there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-012075-012191 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-012123-012382 It's interesting, it's to know history
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-013230-013380 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-013346-013687 And but one needs money, it's an expensive country especially for traveling
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-013940-014050 Uh huh
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-014022-014323 No it's not very dangerous where I am,Columbia is very dangerous
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-014460-014651 I understand
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-014583-014958 There one does not have fun, even though it is a beautiful country
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-014945-015054 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-014993-015321 One is always afraid of the security of the country
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-015375-015457 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-015403-015799 No, Spain is better
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-015608-015738 Yes, if there weren't so many wars, I would like to go to Israel
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-016291-016428 Dangerous
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-016325-016612 Yes, but no if there was no war.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-016626-016715 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-016674-016838 I would like to go there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-016817-017186 Colombia is a fantastic country.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-017173-017289 Ya
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-017200-017501 You have great scenery, some tremendous mountains.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-017487-017617 Yes, I imagine so.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-017610-018123 Yes and we have coast there but the problem is the war
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-017863-017993 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-018184-018485 The drug trafficking that has damaged the country totally and the image that they have of me is horrible
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-018997-019079 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-019052-019127 Between the US is where you'd like to travel or between Canada?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-019831-020050 Canada, I would like to go to Montreal
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-020405-020760 They have told me that it's nice but cold
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-020774-021088 Where we live now, this winter it's just rain and nothing more.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-021355-021457 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-021375-021874 Where we used to live, winters had a lot of snow and it was super cold.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-021861-022011 Where do you live?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-021977-022189 Near Vacouver
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-022243-022421 There is no snow
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-022373-022496 No
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-022455-022585 Impossible
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-022558-022961 We're near the sea
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-022660-022817 Is there snow up North?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-023104-023425 Well sometimes there is but the next day it's gone
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-023432-023528 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-023453-023794 And it doesn't freeze.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-023726-024266 Because here in Los Angeles, there's never snow, except possibly in the mountains.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-024218-024621 Yes, here it falls.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-024403-024498 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-024656-025045 Maybe once every three months or something like that it falls
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-025243-025407 But if it falls, it must fall because you're very far north, Betsy
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-025735-025858 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-025824-026043 Yes, you're near Alaska
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-026050-026343 Yes. But it's not too far, because it's next to the Pacific Ocean.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-027205-027464 Near Seattle Washington.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-027444-027567 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-027539-027751 Have you been to Seattle, Washington?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-027587-027669 Not really.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-027929-028182 I'd like to go there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-028161-028305 Yea
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-028264-028708 Yes. Also Washington, DC. Once I went to the capital
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-028585-028783 0
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-028735-029077 There are some nice things there, like museums. I really like history, so everything that has to do with history and on the classic city in Montreal, Canada.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-029706-029958 Yes, two years ago.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-030047-030307 They say that Canada's really pretty
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-030293-030820 If you like the winter, I mean the snow
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-030779-031154 No, there's not really as much insecurity, like there is here in the United States.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-031175-031687 At least I haven't seen anything too bad
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-031674-031886 It's bad here in the United States.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-031886-032091 Yes,I think
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-031927-032282 It's almost like Latin America now
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-032248-032378 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-032350-032726 Yes, that is why they criticize immigration here a lot because it is a lot of immigration here and it is a bad immigration
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-033034-033143 I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-033239-033492 It has spoiled the country very much
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-033451-033580 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-033539-034038 Throughout the years I have seen this country has really declined.  Now in the United States there is a big difference between the rich and the poor.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-034462-034585 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-034544-034899 That did not happen before, I think in Canada there is more of a balance
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-035002-035138 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-035036-035569 Here is not that much difference between a rich and a poor person in Canada like there is here in the United States
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-035548-035801 There are a lot of poor people here.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-035788-036095 There are more social prog-programs over there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-035856-035952 Yes that is true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-036157-036526 The problem here is that there are a lot of people.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-036512-036943 I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-036580-036997 The country has gone down unfortunately
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-037277-037674 We went to Florida two years ago.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-037558-037783 Yes and it is dangerous
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-037763-037851 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-037824-038063 They can rob you, there is a lot of poverty as almost like a Latin country already
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-038747-038870 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-038842-039355 Yes and you know the Latin countries are known for the difference between the rich and the poor
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-039328-039505 It is true I see
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-039389-039676 The United States is becoming like that
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-039621-039799 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-039751-040195 Yes, but there are interesting things and one time I went to Texas and I liked the views
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-040264-040346 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-040571-040892 I have always liked the Colombian plains
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-040831-041002 Super hot
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-040968-041186 Super hot, but very pretty
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-041070-041248 I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-041200-041624 The plains of Texas are similar, a little more developed and the broiled meat I like it.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-041952-042116 I see there is
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-042027-042526 A lot of broiled meas as bouth in places like that.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-042293-042553 See
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-042553-042949 It is interesting, I would like to know Texas more.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-042908-043025 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-043004-043441 Through its views, through the plains above all, I love the plains the flats the cowboys I like them
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-043838-044104 The horses
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-043927-044309 And the barbecues.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-044234-044624 I see,
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-044343-044583 As they say in Colombia, I love the barbecues.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-044774-044883 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-044835-045129 And you find that a lot in Texas
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-045123-045416 That's great
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-045225-045799 Yes, I think it is one of the most interesting parts of the United States and I would like to visit Seattle because of its cafes. They say they have good coffee there.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-046305-046660 Really? I didn't know that.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-046387-046462 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-046886-047275 My parents are going to El Salvador in November for two months.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-047419-047630 There are volcanoes over there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-047569-047788 Oh, yes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-047760-047911 The scenery must be beautiful over there
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-048020-048164 Yes, there is. But then again, there's poor people, and
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-048710-048895 There's security
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-048744-049127 There are hardly any jobs
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-048963-049038 Yes that's the problem with all the Latin countries that have never been able to get ahead
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-049387-049660 Yes it's true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-049653-049920 I hope one day they can do it
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-049886-050227 Yes, someday
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-050063-050173 I have heard the scenery there is very pretty because there are a lot of volcanoes.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-050323-050466 And yes there are
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-050986-051123 And mountains, and you know salvardor beaches? how are they?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-051601-051703 Yes, they are pretty good. There is one that is called Libertad. And there is another where there are a lot of swimming pools, and sea waves are very big.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-053501-053863 Big waves?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-053555-053945 Hi there, hi wave
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-053993-054416 There is a Pacific and and an Atlantic.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-054027-054150 I thought it was just in the Pacific.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-054498-054703 How many seas are? only pacific
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-054943-055127 Like here
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-055141-055209 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-055161-055462 Florida is the Atlantic
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-055469-055592 Yes
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-055558-055660 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-055626-056104 Because Colombia has the Atlantic and also the pacific, Colombia has two seas
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-056302-056412 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-056371-056624 So it is a very nice country, Columbia, because its beauty trumps many countries.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-056781-057102 Yes, I can imagine.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-056986-057341 Country is the worst but in beauty has much
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-057198-057403 OK
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-057362-057580 It has many queen models
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-057560-057799 The queen models
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-058195-058503 But there are many bad things
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-058435-058804 It's true.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-058599-059063 Yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-059050-059173 Yeah
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-059077-059391 Of that situation, there are bad things.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-059378-059576 I can imagine
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-059412-059794 And not only that, there is insecurities and
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-059712-059835 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-059801-060123 And when you do tourism, you do not want to go to place where something bad could happen
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-060396-060697 Yes, it is true
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-060478-060580 You want to travel to a place where that are not many insecurities.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-061264-061373 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-061318-061619 Even though I tell you, one thing that will scare you
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-061599-061735 What is that?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-061715-062009 I was never mugged in Colombia
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-061988-062125 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-062091-062507 In Spain I was once robbed
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-062480-062617 Really?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-062583-062870 Yes madam
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-062699-062911 How weird
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-062897-063396 I got robbed, too, at a subway train.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-063348-063464 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-063437-063703 They took my wallet
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-063676-063867 Oh no
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-063806-064168 They stole a hundred dollars
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-064182-064462 That was in Spain.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-064271-064708 Not sure ? In Spain?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-064517-064660 In Spain, not Colombia
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-064817-065220 And in Colombia where it's so famous for those things of
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-065173-065384 I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-065234-065630 Nothing was stolen to me because that was one of the reasons that I always too good precautions
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-065774-065911 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-065897-066239 And in Spain when you are taking precautions
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-066218-066389 That's true.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-066690-066792 Yes and you know something? There was a terrorist attack in there too
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-067489-067633 In Spain?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-067571-067920 Yes, some trains were blown-up, they set up bombs, it was due to Arab terrorism
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-068302-068706 In Spain, really?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-068350-068528 Lots of people dies in Spain; this happened in the train station that I used .
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-069095-069437 I see.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-069143-069813 To take a few years ago, I used to be on those places where the attacks took place
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-069744-069997 And that happened recently?
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-070004-070182 About a year ago
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-070161-070236 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-070264-070503 Yes, if something bad is going to happen to you
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-070633-070783 None
20051019_210146_289_fsp-A-070920-071214 It will happen no matter where you are.
20051019_210146_289_fsp-B-071207-071569 That's true. I see.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-000010-000187 Good night I am Joe
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-000208-000578 Hello, where are you from?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-000567-000782 I am from Colorado
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-000776-001017 From Colorado, and originally?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-001017-001163 From Puerto Rico.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-001157-001708 I am in Idaho and am from Chile
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-001698-002003 How long have you been in Chile?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-002014-002432 In the United States ten years, in Idaho three.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-002282-002362 You've been here ten years?  Do you like it? Do you miss your homeland a lot?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-003037-003530 Well, it's like Colorado.  Actually not, since Colorado has a lot of snow
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-003514-003991 This is the season of change!
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-003819-003905 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-004007-004269 From cold to hot, or from hot to cold?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-004232-004494 Of course, and Puerto Rico is not like that, right.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-004312-004387 Today Puerto Rico is. the same weather every year., rainy moment and it's very sunny moments throughout
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-005598-005828 July can be very sunny, and May very rainy.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-006112-006321 But no snow
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-006283-006476 No.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-006423-006707 How long have you been there?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-006669-007012 Oh, I have been here more than twenty years
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-007012-007130 A lot. And since we talk about travelling, have you travelled to Puerto Rico?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-007660-007975 In ninety-three since was the last time that I traveled to Puerto Rico.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-008961-009521 And I have gone, to other places, and parts of the United States also including Florida which is a
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-008962-009048 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-009521-009710 One of my favorite places.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-009712-010082 You have not always lived in Colorado, you have traveled
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-010312-010821 And vacations to other states, here there is a lot to see, I don't know if you have had the opportunity to see other places here in the United States.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-011303-011485 But there are many very beautiful places
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-011335-011850 I went to Washington
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-012728-013001 Washington state that is very beautiful there
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-012750-012910 To Washington, of course. But no, not to the East. Of course, some day I hope to be able to.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-013462-013687 Aand how did you come to stay in Idaho?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-013671-013821 To study
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-013826-013933 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-013837-014142 We came here after I graduated from, from high school, to, to study at University here.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-014282-014362 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-014560-015091 Then call you, because I was expecting, than calling me
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-015096-015219 How great.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-015117-015251 But we have only gone back to Chile once, five years ago. And
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-015744-015804 And
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-015776-016382 We hope to go back now,  this coming year perhaps.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-016451-016875 And it's very hard to travel from here to there because of things like passports and things like that.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-017153-017775 Not so much, but it's more expensive than Idaho. I think that if were in Florida or California, which is the North right?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-017967-018096 We are down below
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-018562-018669 In the middle. Okay, then down below, but around the center.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-019125-019821 Yes it is centrall located for flights.  They travel a lot from here to South America.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-019569-019682 Then it is easier to fly
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-020083-020593 I spend some vacations in Cancun
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-020566-020651 Right
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-020641-021133 And went there for three days with around three hundred fifty dollars
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-021101-021396 Oh no! Really?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-021133-021623 It includes the hotel and the flight.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-021562-022017 Did you see? That's why we don't go anywhere. It costs more than three hundred dollars per ticket. It is very expensive.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-022976-023512 Probably it would be easier for you to go to the State of Washington. Or a more centrally located place and fly somewhere else if you'd like to.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-024048-024605 Yes. Have you traveled outside America or you have not had the chance?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-024525-024883 I'd love to go to Europe.  One of my brothers lives in Whichita, Kansas and the other lives in Puerto Rico.  They travel a lot.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-025371-025505 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-025387-025982 They have traveled to, Paris and Spain, and said it was very beautiful.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-025960-026266 What country, would you live to travel to if you could?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-026266-026683 One of my favorites is Australia.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-026683-026860 Yes, in Australia
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-026780-027362 Australia is facinating and exciting, so is New Zealand. I would like to visit Italy, Spain, and france, but I think Australia is number one.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-027750-027851 If I could pick, I think it would be Italy.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-028650-028982 Italy is beautiful.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-028746-029121 Yes but I'm not sure, maybe Italy; although Australia is huge. There is so much to do there.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-029164-029351 I worked for a company with an Australian CEO. We developed a great friendship.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-030916-031430 And he would always invite me to go there, but I have a daughter of five years, I am a divorced father.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-031435-031623 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-031451-031660 Have divided custody.w
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-031682-031800 Of course.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-031687-031816 So,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-031842-032008 You will stay,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-031848-032158 I would never abandon her.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-032030-032121 Of course. At least five more years
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-032389-032785 Yes, when she forgets she has a father and starts to think in boyfriends. Yes.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-032951-033337 Of course. When she doesn't want anything to do with you for a short time, right?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-033187-033267 I am crazy for her and she is crazy for me
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-033739-033980 Of course, right now is difficult.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-033792-034103 We have a great time.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-033991-034585 We have small children also and that makes it complicated to travel.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-034457-034580 Right. well I want to go to Puerto Rico next year so that she knows her Puerto Rican half, because her mom is Mexican
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-035113-035183 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-035373-035973 Grandma comes here every year and they do great with each other
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-036423-036953 You're going to take her there, but what age are you planning to go
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-036873-037205 She
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-037221-037317 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-037285-037714 Travelled more than me in the last three years because she goes to Mexico, with her mother, at least two times a year
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-038008-038373 She's constantly
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-038325-038919 She's well used to traveling. She's really calm. I tell you, the first time we travelled it wasn't on the plan, but when we took a travel to Wichita
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-039433-039499 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-039471-039995 We went on a greyhound and it was awful.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-040007-040076 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-040266-040649 She shaved her legs. She put on pants, put on dresses.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-040628-040790 I can imagine
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-040708-041041 I think she thought she had a very bad nightmare, and people there was really uncomfortable, and they said stuff
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-041491-041544 Of course
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-041551-041790 And it was awful travel, but
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-041700-042010 How old was she?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-041983-042182 When she woke up, she panicked.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-042107-042375 She didn't understand
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-042182-042344 I promised I would never take her there in a bus.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-042932-043033 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-042949-043140 The next time we went on a little plane and we had a great time.  She was very happly.  And it was only
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-044143-044565 Compared to thirteen hours travel, it is one hour when we took the bus.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-044485-044807 Yes, that is so.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-044651-044748 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-044807-045548 No, it is great tha tpeople like travelling because whe is going to want to travel.  People who really do not like travelling really cannot believe it.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-044807-044919 It was horrible.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-045567-045776 Who don't like to travel?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-045723-046076 I would love to see the whole plane if I could.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-046060-046154 Of course.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-046151-046553 I love to travel but economy and situations is very difficult for me
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-047025-047496 You one who has children have to be here responsible
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-047421-047582 Yes, exactly.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-047550-047785 Put your feet on the ground for a while.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-047753-047983 You have the opportunity go to other places, come to Colorado
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-048583-048803 I have heard it is really slow.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-048766-049028 It is beautiful, you come here,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-048916-049108 Many woods
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-049039-049237 It has many national forests,majestic mountains, attractions points in the city,little bit of everything. But you go to the mountains and to fabulous places, the beauty as is you were in a paradise.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-050989-051267 And how long have you lived there in Colorado.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-051230-051466 I've been living here twenty-six years.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-051444-051583 Wow

20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-052901-053014 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-052955-053308 I came here with my first ex-wife.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-053314-053410 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-053357-053892 We were married for ten years and then went separate ways.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-053908-054241 And she was American or, where was she from?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-053946-054053 But, she was half Puerto Rican and half Swiss.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-054439-054648 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-054546-054825 She was studying. he took the classes as independent studies,  while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling in Mexico.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-054819-054932 Yes
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-054910-055575 Yes we got along well, and we ended it fine at the end we realized we had different goals.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-055483-055719 Does that one change a lot?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-055698-055933 Change a lot
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-055751-055858 Back at that time
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-055976-056416 The mother of my daughter, it was a super short marriage.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-055998-056126 Sure.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-056437-056571 It didn't even last two years.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-056448-056533 She is from Mexico
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-056887-057101 She is from Oaxaca Mexico
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-057128-057257 Yeah
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-057144-057541 We have a good father relation with this girl. We work very well together, and even went to her kindergarden shool today.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-058092-058178 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-058146-058526 The teacher gave a good report on my girl, because she has a good heart.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-059196-059432 She goes with my cousin's husband he wears her long skit
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-059421-059817 How rare is very rich.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-059491-059587 She's very respectful has much love of God and she has good principals and she is hungry to learn.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-060819-060991 Now where does she live?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-060975-061280 My ex husband, you say?
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-061253-061425 Yeah,with the girl.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-061333-061955 She is my sister
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-061928-062137 You can see her often.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-062110-062426 I see her three times a week every week.more on other activities like today
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-062453-062619 Look how father.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-062823-063016 We share with her
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-063032-063219 Good.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-063187-063321 Yes.  That is good.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-063241-063867 If you are from Puerto Rico it does not cost you to come in and out of United States
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-063792-063985 No, absolutely.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-063969-064226 I have never understood where the United State's stands with Puerto Rico, because it is not a state it is a separate country, but
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-064955-065244 Well it was invaded by Americans in eighteen thousand and ninety eight.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-065523-065662 Yeah
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-065528-065812 They took away from the Spanish. From there they established American governors, and from there they dominated until they start to govern. have Puerto Rican governors
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-066594-066905 They have puerto Ricans with citizenship just like in nineteen-fifty-four.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-067237-067419 It has not been that long.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-067258-067548 But Puerto Rico, no. Not that long. For example, when my parents were born they were not citizens, but I have been a citizen my entire life.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-068105-068175 Sure
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-068110-068292 From then forward they started free commerce which is a free association with United States but without being a state.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-069262-069514 Over there they vote for the primaries from here, but they do not vote in the presidential election.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-070055-070575 Then in some way it is Independent
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-070082-070183 None
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-070591-071089 Independent or union with United States would be very difficult because Puerto Rico would become a totally independent Country because,
20051019_230329_292_fsp-A-071378-071491 Independent.
20051019_230329_292_fsp-B-071491-071844 They would have to approve first there but they have never approved and never been approved
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-000085-000358 Good evening Mildred
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-000380-000605 Hello, how are you? What is your name?

20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-001841-002002 Forgive me.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-001880-002126 I don't think I did.  Are you in Puerto Rico?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-002308-002373 Yes

20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-003305-003514 Yes, it is very good music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-003493-003637 You like it, don't you?

20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-003937-004135 What music do you listen to?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-004178-004462 Well, I like all music, jazz, a bit of classical. I listen to contemporary, alternative and fusion music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-005946-006223 It's like a merger of jazz
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-006205-006575 Rock and all that
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-006289-006412 A break
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-006658-006808 Reaggeton and all that
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-006819-007092 No, do you like Reggaeton?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-007095-007170 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-007146-007339 Do you like Reggaeton?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-007317-007521 I listen to reggaeton, rap, and everything else.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-007532-007644 Yes, sure
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-007954-008553 Rock, I don't like it that much but I do listen to it. I can't listen to it for a long time, just a bit. I can spend a whole night listening to Rock music, no.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-008849-009089 I'm not a Rocker.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-008941-009293 I like rock.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-009089-009712 I like Bachata, Merengue, Salsa, everything. Classical music.

20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-009712-010089 Romantic music, nice, yes, I think that music let's you know a bit about other cultures, it helps get to know people from other countries.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-010650-010898 Yes, but
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-010783-010896 And
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-010898-011466 Everyone is making the same music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-012179-012381 In the United States; in Mexico they are just copying it. It's become a global gender.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-013061-013314 I've listened to it, I don't really like it but it is impressive that everybody is now listening to Hip-Hop.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-014038-014204 I think it's Reggaeton, it's becoming popular
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-014550-014665 0
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-014619-014962 In Mexico, Mexican music uses lots of Hip-Hop and there are lots of rock bands that use Hip-Hop or stuff like that
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-015751-016060 I think that it is helping bringing people together, even if they are from many different nations, Mexican people like salsa, some others that are from
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-016660-016741 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-016726-017057 Different countries like salsa, too, and merengue, and bachata. And when you go to dances,
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-017062-017239 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-017361-017620 There
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-017378-017673 I do enjoy dancing merengue and salsa music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-017620-017882 People from many different countries dancing.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-017860-018112 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-017882-018375 I like Mexican music because it has a good rythm, I like Ranchera music, I love it, yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-018396-018482 Yes, Rancheras
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-018828-019081 I like them
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-018830-018942 Yes, they are good, I do like them too but, sometimes I don't know the tunes, it's interesting to get to know music from other countries like
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-020228-020512 Have you ever listened to Arab or Turkish music?
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-020520-020593 Yes, Aha!
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-020711-020845 That's interesting, it's good too.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-020857-021218 The chinese music is very beautiful
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-020949-021037 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-021218-021725 Yes, especially if someone knew how to interpret, it would be more beautiful because they always present like a history when they do presentations, of them with the woman that are moving their hands
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-022289-022496 Yes, and those fans
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-022312-022414 Yes.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-022671-022974 They use it to tell...
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-022950-023357 Since they tell something with music, the music has no lyrics, so they are painting an image.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-024112-024648 This, a scenery, having lyrics always makes it related to feeling or story, or the Mexican music like the corridos
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-025146-025617 The storytellers are well known for telling stories of different people and different events.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-026423-026666 We are brought to old times with the natives.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-026967-027091 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-027274-027992 The slaves were the first that used music and dances in order to complain and say
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-028275-028398 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-028411-028916 The evil with which they were treated, they were expressing all of their
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-028553-028746 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-028916-029059 Their discontent
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-029057-029223 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-029191-029410 I believe that music will always continue for centuries
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-029833-029978 Clearly
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-029860-030420 Reggaeton will always unite the people wherever you go
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-030433-030535 Yes already
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-030983-031333 I don't know if you remember that Japanese band The Band of Light.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-031489-031607 I see
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-031703-031929 That they began to play salsa
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-031730-031880 No.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-032019-032254 Yes, and they were Japanese and spent a lot of time here and I didn't know that they would last but they played a lot in New York and they didn't have discos when they originally played.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-033396-033600 The same salsa discos that they did in Japanese music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-034033-034242 Japanese
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-034374-034834 If japanese came here they would be safe
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-034387-034548 No I have never heard of them
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-034834-035128 They can say it, although they don't understand
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-035019-035282 I see
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-035128-035264 I think that's pretty and relaxing music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-035282-035456 Yes. Me too.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-035860-036141 One of it's uses is to relax.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-035868-035961 It's very relaxing for distractions.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-036244-036307 I have discos while going out in Puerto Rico with the music that came that was recorded in Rio.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-037087-037301 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-037134-037425 It's one to relax to
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-037355-037435 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-037425-037627 When you want to be quiet at home you can light those scented candles and relax. That helps a lot
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-037997-038095 Sounds like pure ambient
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-038567-038649 You need music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-039522-039727 A little more aggressive
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-039717-039985 Yes. It is that music is
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-039727-039982 Music calms you
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-040012-040553 Music can be very important also like for liberation
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-041254-041458 There is a singer whose music is called Afro bit, his name is Cela Kuti and this gentleman,he for the civil war of Nigeria
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-042514-042835 He was very important because he made revolutionary movements. People didn't see him as a musician but rather as a political leader.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-043722-043801 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-043732-044005 Through the music he moved people. Then, when he released new albums.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-044051-044123 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-044312-044679 The military was infuriated and some time he had the entire community who had the same political philosophy practicing like him.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-045573-046061 All of them lived together in communities. When he released an album called Zombie, that criticized the army because they were like puppets of the government that were
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-046786-047010 People sometimes kill their own race.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-047062-047145 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-047073-047555 He said everything in his song and the military heard it and
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-047405-047912 Yes.  They extradited him from the country.  They voted him.......
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-047903-048556 They jailed him and beat him and burned his whole house.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-048640-048924 Yes because it was protest music they called it
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-048932-049296 The music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-049039-049714 In Puerto rico they had topo, and who else sang that kind of protest music? juan Manuel sang protest songs, and sometimes made concerts.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-050083-050175 Yes of course
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-050579-050979 They sang the truth about villages
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-050641-050753 Yes that it
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-050979-051433 Against the government
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-051305-051621 People that make a riot out of everything, and the government doesn't like that.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-051433-051936 They try to to make people not go to those kinds of things.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-051873-052050 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-052136-052481 But it's interesting because they make history.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-052141-052232 It gets involved in history, music will always reflect what other people are living in the moment, and what they think.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-053196-053292 I think that same thing
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-053491-053639 Yeah, that's good
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-053603-054067 They need music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-053939-054069 Always
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-054067-054848 They tell love stories, disgraces, people problems.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-054846-054942 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-054848-054994 Daily life has many uses.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-055007-055125 Yes I think it's necessary that we need air to live.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-056353-056429 I think that when I put on music, I clean the house faster.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-056866-056962 And if you don't play music, you don't play an instrument.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-057567-058237 No, I've always liked the piano, and my daughters like piano classes, I never had the opportunity of my mom paying for piano classes for me.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-058283-058372 Yeah
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-058596-059085 I like playing the guitar and the violin
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-059099-059207 The violin
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-059219-059570 The violin is an instrument that I don't know so much about, but it has precise music.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-059710-060024 Not that much, I had a friend at school, that knew how to play the violin really good.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-060567-060747 The violin is good,accordion music as well.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-060830-061017 Yes, but like you said, Mexican music uses a lot of accordions.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-061446-061526 In Puerto rico people we call it 'gicaro' of land, when they go out for Christmas and all that.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-062335-062416 Yeah
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-063048-063251 You don't play an instrument
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-063326-063498 I play the guitar and base. And I've tried playing the piano, but it's too hard. I can't do it.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-064366-064494 I just left it there.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-064386-064680 My boyfriend plays bass, but not anymore, he's older now
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-064805-064891 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-065038-065156 But
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-065046-065137 Yeah
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-065156-065419 He played with bands and groups he played the base
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-065592-065812 It's always good to play music
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-065812-065898 None
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-065844-066037 That serves to let it off one's chest. When I want to get distracted, I take my bass, and I play a little.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-066696-066926 I see, it relaxes you
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-066707-066980 It distracts me, if it relaxes me
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-067082-067194 I see, that is good.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-067205-067328 Yes
20051022_180817_311_fsp-A-067221-067301 It's good, we have a lot of that.
20051022_180817_311_fsp-B-067730-067840 None

20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-001756-001922 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-001947-002159 And you?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-001988-002114 I've spent ten years in

20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-004530-004892 If your'e going to ha you'll want to be careful with the boys
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-004847-005018 Right. So, at that young age, she asks me when she can have a boyfriend. I say, a lot of time will pass before that can happen.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-005843-006186 At twenty five years
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-006075-006231 Yes, more or less. It could be.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-006367-006478 Why come?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-006392-006634 Tonightâ€™s topic is
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-006518-006609 Where do you live?  In a big city?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-007097-007167 Denver is a pretty big city
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-007429-007494 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-007505-007726 I live in Aurora nearby Denver.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-007716-007781 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-007726-008154 It's a city too, pretty big, but is doesn't have tall buildings like Denver.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-008370-008607 And a little more quiet
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-008546-008854 I wouldn't say that is more quiet, I would say
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-008708-008823 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-008854-009130 Because it has a mixture of all,
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-009090-009206 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-009156-009488 Good people, bad ones, every ethnic group. You have high crimes around too, and you seem to live a little fear
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-010117-010213 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-010132-010389 I lived in a house before. I live in an apartment, and I found some nasty situations around here.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-010827-010942 Yeah ?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-010852-011114 Including gun shots and things like that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-011149-011300 What kind of place would you like to live in?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-011854-011949 If I could go, I would go to a calmer place, a small village, rather than a city.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-012458-012558 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-012619-012961 I am tired of the city, I drive here every day, and the traffic in denver is horrible.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-013409-013525 Yeah
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-013424-013696 Too many cars, and the school where my girl goes it takes me a long time, and sometimes waiting for about an hour and half just driving, before going to work.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-014738-014859 Wow
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-014823-015327 When you arrive to work you're all stressed out
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-015312-015493 A little more relaxed
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-015447-015629 With a big headache, yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-015593-016021 The difference is that it is calm here.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-015996-016087 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-016026-016263 Really calm
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-016132-016263 Is it a village?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-016283-016721 Idaho is mainly land.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-016947-017093 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-016963-017255 I man the biggest city, Boyce
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-017239-017385 Yes, over there.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-017285-017667 But it's a relaxed city and it kind of small
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-017476-017546 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-017697-018176 And that is the biggest city.  The next biggest, I would say, if Idaho Falls, Idaho.  But I do not cpmsoder tjat os as bog/
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-018654-018744 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-018689-018931 Because it's not a city. there are no big buildings
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-019545-019630 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-019620-020068 And so there is, it's what is here, it's a big town. But
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-020114-020275 And how is the crime, and things like that?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-020385-020904 Oh, nothing happens. Here, people leave the doors open, their cars unlocked.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-020743-020884 How cool
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-020934-021035 And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-020954-021171 That doesn't happen in Aurora.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-021100-021508 Of course, it's very peaceful. No dad, the daily news here talks about someone lost something.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-022434-022691 If something did happen it would be the news of the
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-022550-022827 They're not about crimes, nor any of that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-022741-023119 Of course of the month.  No absolutely not.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-022932-023244 What most delicious thing.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-023124-023325 Too quiet.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-023300-023587 Well I'm going over there then, to be your neighbors.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-023531-024020 It's super peaceful
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-024367-024593 It's all the opposite of Denver
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-024377-024488 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-024598-024785 Aurora.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-024684-025074 It is too quiet. There is not much to do. Here the people like things outdoors
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-025424-025464 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-025464-025706 Camping, and fishing, and going to the mountains to ski, and
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-025852-026078 We like going to the mountains, camping, etc.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-026516-026657 Of course, well.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-026632-026884 There are people everywhere.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-026879-027015 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-026904-027352 Many places that who have come these people, they have brought many bad habits too.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-027362-027493 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-027387-027609 Things happen that make you live in fear.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-028031-028142 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-028046-028323 With my daughter I am always in fear, because there is a lot of talk on the news of what happens in crime in Aurora
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-028802-028942 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-028837-029275 What? Yes, shots. They stole this, they ran over a kid, and the driver of the car is on the run.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-029622-029667 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-029652-029793 Things like that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-029703-029904 Like city
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-029929-030045 Sorry?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-029954-030010 I used to live in Chile. I also lived in Santiago it's the capital.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-030432-030523 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-030498-030825 It's different to live in a city. I mean, you can't leave your doors open. You can't trust no one
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-031444-031812 You can't leave you're car, the CDs.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-031625-031736 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-031812-032149 They break the windows to steal them
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-032134-032255 Everything
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-032169-032300 The CDs
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-032315-032511 Yes, that doesn't happen everyone, but
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-032335-032652 I never leave anything flashy in the car.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-032672-032758 It is a  quite, safe and good place to raise kids.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-033447-033568 That's good. I dream of a place like that. The only problem is
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-033609-033744 That's why.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-033926-034233 I have, a divorced father, I have a daughter
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-034187-034283 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-034238-034389 My ex-wife and I share custody
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-034741-034988 You have to be close to
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-034917-035577 Yes, I would never leave my girl behind. I want to stay near her until she grows up.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-035360-035441 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-035592-035823 One day, she'll get married and forget about Me! I hope that won't happen, but it does most of the time.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-036332-036498 It happens a lot
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-036347-036483 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-036508-037067 But, nothing, I would like to, live in a more quiet place. My brother lives in Kansas
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-037062-037182 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-037092-037333 And it is very quiet there, also.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-037308-037515 Of course.  No.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-037354-037721 They have festivals, people are more quiet no.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-037721-037892 A little tired, yes. But God willing, in two or three weeks, when I have the baby, I am going to feel better.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-037877-038325 Here, there many beautiful things. Not everything here is ugly or anything like that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-038315-038426 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-038335-038672 It's since there are people living and more people moving,  there are cities in Colorado that are more bigger that the ones growing in most of all America
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-039322-039432 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-039367-039654 That also has its problems.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-039619-039795 That is what I miss. Because here there is a lot to do. Besides the things you do outdoors, there is no opera here
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-040615-040968 The mall is very small. There are no places to visit, or ballet, concerts, and things like that. Those things are not around here.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-041612-042186 Then that one is a city that is in Utah.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-042156-042276 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-042211-042760 If you like t do things like that, go to concerts, opera, theater or a show.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-043288-043666 No, there is not. You have to drive three to four hours to see something like that. Nothing happens here. The only thing is the universities, those have time shows.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-044441-044718 You miss that from the city? No, that
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-044446-044557 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-044748-045005 You can find that type of fun stuff, but at the same time there is
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-045060-045171 No, here you have the opposite. Here, they have
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-045322-045508 With all the tranquility and other. I liked that a lot, when we lived in Utah
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-045795-045880 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-045840-046233 In the city you have all that you want
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-046223-046308 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-046243-046389 It's quiet.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-046354-046474 And it's right, you have lots of relaxing parts. And there it has lots of family attractions,
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-047068-047164 Right
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-047098-047360 For adults, for singles, everything. In reality you have all that right here we I work, it's a high-tech company are of
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-048181-048256 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-048256-048835 Then, too, there is an amphitheater one block from my work, and sometimes we hear the concerts while working.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-049092-049172 Right
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-049097-049238 THE BUILDING
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-049208-049701 I would like to live near things that have activities and stuff
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-049645-050033 Ere you don't miss he activities. in the city you have lots of crimes.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-050743-051130 You have parts of right here, border areas too that are fairly quiet and
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-051468-051750 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-051548-051845 Even though there are lots of people, they care each other pretty well without fear of robbery
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-052535-052630 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-052580-053018 In this, as a limit to, it is a mixture of good and bad.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-052998-053109 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-053053-053285 Understand? The bad ones, well they are the ones who like to take advantage.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-053426-053557 Of course
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-053501-053899 Do you live with fear or calm?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-053894-054030 Of course.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-053984-054307 But traffic is horrible, let me tell you.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-054221-054543 Well, I don't really miss.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-054307-054392 It is really horrible. Because sometimes taxi drivers and on winter days it is still worse. Because when there start to be all these accidents and you cannot move on the highway
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-055167-055369 Snow and ice and all that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-055454-055550 It is terrible.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-055595-056018 That is not at all strange
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-055958-056350 I always dream like that with a quiet place. Some day I think that whatever, it is going to be possible.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-056531-056758 Well, yes. Because where your daughter lives, she lives very close, too. No?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-056989-057427 She lives close to here, I live in Aurora, Colorado and she lives about three miles from there.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-057241-057307 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-057513-057674 In what was my home. And also to the home of my ex-wife, which was my house then, they came in also. One time, they came in through the
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-058439-058661 Because the house has three levels.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-058651-058781 None
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-058691-059239 And in the basement, it isn't like a basement. What did it stay up, the windows?
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-059265-059401 OK
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-059290-059587 Then they get in through the back and the basement, I mean below the house, and they steal a lot of things from it.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-060050-060387 They were not in the house.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-060317-060568 No, she had gone with some coworker. I went to the house and inspected, and gave her my recommendations that she will have to lock this and that because
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-061197-061505 It doesn't let it exposed to the thiefs right
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-061484-061585 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-061555-061746 They have get in her car about three times
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-062642-062828 That's makes me angry
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-062687-063286 Three times they have broken her windows, took her cds, they had robbed her stereo
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-063307-063498 That's make me angry
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-063357-063513 That's a bad thing about living in the city, there are too many kinds of attractions!
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-064031-064218 You have to
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-064087-064228 Disadvantages
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-064233-064399 You have to be careful.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-064409-064530 I missed that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-064434-064832 There are somebody who comes from other place and take advantages of the circumstances.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-065325-065486 Exactly
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-065461-065708 They relax
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-065723-065833 Hey.  Do you have.......
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-065728-065838 And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-065838-065944 Sorry. Continue.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-065939-066246 For example when that happened, the news here were that this man came and killed his family, and he took away two kids
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-066936-067172 I remember that.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-067147-067635 Yes, because, precisely, they are living here in the field and the children, you never know that somebody like that can come over here
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-067817-067917 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-067983-068088 And
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-067998-068295 Crime could happen anywhere
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-068229-068345 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-068345-068546 It's sad, that one
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-068461-068838 And you have to be careful always
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-068708-069080 And don't be so trusting with certain people, strangers especially
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-069246-069427 Sure
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-069332-069719 I teach my daughter not to trust strangers.
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-070041-070434 When you have kids, then you start to worry, that's terrible
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-070585-070671 You start to teach them, they don't have to knock here or there
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-071129-071516 Sure, when you have kids, at least you can take care yourself, but
20051023_232057_325_fsp-A-071481-071567 Yes
20051023_232057_325_fsp-B-071516-071667 You are not daughters anymore

20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-006530-006828 Before coming here to study?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-006893-007459 I lived in Singapore for 2 years and before that it was Ciudad de Mexico
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-007494-007595 That's it
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-007924-008035 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-008015-008358 It's hotter here
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-008141-008525 I've getting used to tropics
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-008363-008656 It's very hot in Singapur, right?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-008651-008981 Then, it's tropical. Nothing else, then.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-008984-009146 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-009008-009209 What's going on?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-009343-009616 And then here, it's cold and
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-009813-009914 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-009823-009898 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-009914-010418 And in the air it rains for a week, I don't understand how they can survive this time
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-009929-010090 No, there's cold, and yes, there's no sunlight. After the summer it feels nice, but a week like that, a little cold
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-011202-011530 Not a lot. I like that, but yes, it is only the beginning of a terrible winter.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-011994-012121 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-012211-012563 This is what I don't like
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-012292-012479 What happens to the cold until December is
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-013257-013525 Christmas will be over when you return
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-013570-013651 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-013762-013909 When the cold hits me at Christmas it knocks me out!
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-014222-014333 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-014339-014658 Yes please
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-014454-014621 Yes, I know my brother studies in Cornell, which is farther north, about six hours from Philadelphia, but is
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-015461-015624 Further north
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-015585-015712 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-015624-015838 It is so cold that classes don't start until the end of January, until maybe the 28th of January.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-016292-016535 Wow. Really?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-016472-016871 He says that it is so cold that it is better to spend more days in May than to spend the days in January Right? The students Because...
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-017484-017732 Ah
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-017710-017886 You are 15 years old?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-018439-018606 It cannot be
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-018560-018732 And my brother.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-018626-019121 And I was thinking about going there. Good that I didn't go, I couldn't survive.I swear that I wouldn't survive.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-019242-019496 Really, and my brother well he was lucky enough to get a what they call a town house
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-020045-020181 Yeah
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-020049-020384 But, it was a lot bigger, then you went in and they had a little living room and a kitchen, and then you went up and they had all the rooms but
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-020932-021149 They were some of the university's new dormitories
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-021500-021686 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-021529-021701 They had built it in the university's outskirts, so it was pretty far from the university.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-022414-022813 The engineering classes were held at the other side of the university
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-022737-022924 Poor guy
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-022868-022984 There's a bus system there
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-023925-024205 Why don't you use public transportation? Because I don't want to pay the fifty dollars.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-024525-024797 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-024540-024891 He spend the whole semester walking, and during the winter, it was like twenty degrees, and he walked, he walked forty minutes to get to class
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-025879-026120 My brother
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-025898-026111 Poor guy
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-026120-026396 No, It's
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-026277-026752 He brought it on himself
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-026396-026541 He's just cheap, right? He didn't want to pay the fifty dollars, so I said that's ridiculous.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-027226-027497 No, because the bus only stops four times every hour, so he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes, something like that
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-027919-028080 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-028039-028252 My brother
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-028141-028515 What grade is your brother in?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-028252-028382 No, now he is in the eighth grade
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-028702-028868 Okay.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-028848-029015 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-028974-029085 That's fine.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-029030-029277 What do you think about the crime wave here in Philadelphia?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-029353-029580 About what? About the crime wave?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-029489-029671 The crime wave, yes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-029595-029888 I have not heard much about it here in Philly or rather I have heard that were some persons who are rob on forty first or whatever.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-030373-030520 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-030414-030671 But I think that I have always been lucky. Because I have been walking alone at night on 41st, and going to the store,
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-031358-031651 I go to the fruit shops on forty eighth and nothing has ever happened to me.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-031939-032277 Do you walk to forty eighth street?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-032141-032338 Yes, by myself as happy as ever with my life. Besides, I don't even think about it, not even paying attention. I don't walk around in fear or anything like that.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-032893-032989 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-032909-033045 And nothing has ever happened to me, I have no reason to be scared of anything, to the contrary,once I get there they are all super friendly.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-033675-033869 Then I'm not sure
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-033681-033808 Yes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-033904-034101 I think I'm lucky because is the same in Mexico. In other words, all my friends in Mexico have a story about been robbed or kidnapped or something that they have done to them.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-034823-035242 Nothing has ever happened to me even when I'm along late at night in bad areas. All those things they say you shouldn't do
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-035843-035974 I understand
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-035850-036298 I've done all of them at the same time and nothing has happened to me.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-036116-036555 The
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-036383-036686 Yes, trust me. I see what has been done. Yes, I remember what I have done and I say to myself, how did I dare to do that?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-037151-037444 What was I thinking? I was a very irresponsible teenager, but nothing happened to me.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-037924-038025 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-037974-038489 Have you met Philly?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-038883-039242 Good
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-038893-039095 What's it like?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-039256-039556 With me it is the same old story.  Nothing has happened to me either.  So I think I live in.......
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-040107-040514 I live in Walnut, between the thirty eight and the thirty nine
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-040752-040939 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-040788-041212 It's not that far away, and there are lots of police here. In general, I haven't met anyone who has gone through that, so I really think that
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-042121-042227 It does happen, right? I read it in the paper and
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-042358-042535 Yes.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-042512-042643 I think in general it is weird because we have so many security cameras around here.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-043262-043444 Yes, we do too.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-043390-043766 Lights and they have some phones, cops have bikes, it's unbelievable that they have
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-044257-044454 They spend lots of money in that but in general, they are keeping us safe.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-044858-045136 Yes, they have lots of them
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-044868-045191 I imagine that the people from the neighborhood are criminals so they have to be careful with security.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-045918-046181 I think that they can to the people that do crimes, in general, it's very safe.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-047104-047284 In the, quad, because before that it was security  no it wasn't so strict, because one had to pass there, and one gave the card to someone else.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-048202-048444 And then they would go get him. Ask, What's his name? to the system, to see if one was actually a student from there or not.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-049080-049289 They didn't make an illegal copy of it, right?
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-049540-049626 OK
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-049625-049998 The thing is that people could have gone in and out like nothing, but they now have those systems, those new doors, that
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-050498-050751 You can't do anything so they won't worry about one person in the University.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-051121-051242 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-051246-051406 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-051272-051580 Yes, in general, in Philadelphia there are a few zones where I wouldn't go.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-051969-052171 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-052005-052414 I don't like it, like at night like in the center city there are a few places where I don't like walking too.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-052671-052808 No
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-052696-052823 I don't really know the city well, I don't know the people here.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-053237-053338 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-053242-053535 I mean, in Mexico, I would see someone, and then cross the street or not.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-053787-053914 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-053803-054111 And here it's like I don't know. It's like I'm scared about something or someone.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-054323-054429 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-054393-054590 No
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-054429-054780 Philadelphia has lots of neighborhoods that are dangerous
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-054671-054904 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-054780-055006 They have secure neighborhoods, right?one has from the university that is secure
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-055792-056075 Yes one goes north, north philly, all that then south philly, and west philly, it's not necessary
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-056833-057063 It gets dangerous. If one wants to go out at night, they won't go to North Philly
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-057909-058035 Yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-057984-058141 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-058035-058179 Well, for us
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-058181-058338 Yes me too.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-058303-058439 Why yes, if one goes out, one goes to Philadelphia, but that's an old city, so they have cops and everything.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-059276-059409 So
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-059318-059560 But, why don't you know anyone in Philadelphia that knows history about robberies.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-059909-060292 Yes, in general there aren't really many students in the old city. The majority of the student stay in the university.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-060772-061045 Okay.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-060829-060909 I think, in general, but people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-061843-061953 Generally every week someone will read the
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-062772-063089 There was a robbery, or something, so one goes, and naturally thinks, what's happening. Right? but
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-063621-063878 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-063831-063991 Twenty thousand students will jump
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-064943-065098 That happened to one
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-065101-065338 Yes, also
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-065141-065464 Of course it exists, right? But it is not that tall.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-065469-065742 Of course, they are in a lot and neither is that much more expensive that happens if you are walking alone or in
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-066101-066308 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-066121-066500 That is how it always happens
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-066747-066878 It seems to me, it is better to live in university high-rises because if one returns over there in the night
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-067939-068106 It is very calm
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-067958-068287 Well, it is nice to have to
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-068111-068303 Do not worry about anything
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-068287-068529 The squares in Baltimore are huge.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-068863-069010 And there is not light.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-069055-069193 Yes, huge.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-069328-069479 No light.
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-069479-069611 There is no light
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-069484-069621 On the blocks
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-069621-069742 Yes, there is no light. In high-rises it is better, more calms one does not have to buy all of the furniture
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-070489-070641 None
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-070555-070989 If something happens, one calls the university and they take care of them
20051024_180453_327_fsp-A-070979-071171 Yes
20051024_180453_327_fsp-B-071030-071338 I've heard a lot of stories of problems between people that share an apartment.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-000020-000106 Hi

20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-002962-003037 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-003063-003133 And you?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-003174-003422 I am in the linguistics program
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-003432-003523 Do you have something to do with this program?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-003740-004321 Know people who wear it and I know the LDC and what they do.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-004038-004124 Ah. Okay.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-004347-004554 But, no.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-004377-004635 How final are they making this program
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-004822-005125 What the LDC does is collect many types of linguistic data. It might be text, or something spoken, and then it can be used for many things. For example,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-005671-005711 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-006065-006434 Programs that understand voice need traning
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-006485-006571 Okay.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-006808-006985 A supreme being
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-006975-007091 Okay
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-007026-007501 And then, for example, it's possible for studies how people pronounce the letter this way, up to the dialog, how it develops, I don't know, what or for
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-007809-007875 Wow
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-008294-008957 For many things. And the LDC, they collect data for many languages, and then the people
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-008785-008845 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-008957-009396 Can do more things, more applications or more studies, more theories. Right?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-009351-009502 More specialized.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-009462-009614 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-009573-009836 Okay. And this where you live here in Philadelphia, in what neighborhood or?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-010144-010210 I live in West Philly, but not very west, let's say I live at forty-third and Spruce.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-010771-010877 That is not that west
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-011287-011454 No too much west
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-011398-011459 Yes, I live on campus.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-011514-011615 And
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-011838-012005 I live on the 40th floor
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-012025-012106 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-012030-012131 In the skyscrapers
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-012146-012227 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-012257-012621 And, how do you feel the air living so high at 43th?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-012641-013101 Well, I like it a lot before I came here.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-012879-012950 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-013162-013718 They told me, good, that Philadelphia was little dangeous and such, and
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-013703-013764 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-013718-014092 Caution with West Philly, including the guide that spread in the campus they say it's dangerous go out at night
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-014497-014577 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-014507-014835 Right, this is my second year.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-014820-014946 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-014896-015315 I didn't see nothing and no bad things happened to me, I don't feel unsafe either
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-015725-016276 Don't know, because I watch few things. The news around here, they scare you a bit
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-016144-016281 Yes.  Also that.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-016331-016463 And I don't know, I say nothing bad happened to me ever, and I would say I feel safe, I don't feel like being I danger. But I know people that do feel like that, they get scared about West Philly, and
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-017934-018020 There are a lot of people that get intimidated by black people here
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-018459-018717 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-018788-018894 Eh to me.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-018793-019233 That is his problem.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-019061-019177 Yes. It is how a lot of people associate West Philly with the neighborhood, like it was a ghetto?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-020138-020279 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-020219-020507 The black neighborhood is unsafe
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-020315-020451 Yes, that too.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-020562-020638 But
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-020648-020896 Tell me
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-020658-020759 I don't feel intimidated, because I have a good friend that I have lived close to for 45 years.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-021442-021533 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-021497-021750 I walk over there frequently. At night too,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-022033-022175 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-022064-022276 I meet a lot of people at night because I have to cross the park
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-022675-022751 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-022741-023302 Here are lots of people, there too, at night, then, at two in the morning they are rumbling there
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-023469-023737 Never threatened me. They never ask for a cigarette.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-023984-024171 Mhm
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-024136-024374 Truly no, I don't see them provoking, there
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-024581-025122 It's true that things happen to people. I know a girl that was attacked.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-025112-025233 Ok.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-025162-025268 Those things happen in every city.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-025344-025420 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-025647-025941 There are crimes in every city, and I believe that happens here.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-026239-026330 Yes,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-026401-026729 They give it much attention . It shows up on TV,  newspapers, and ends up creating a state of a bit collective.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-026946-027058 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-027305-027467 Of psychosis, no and
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-027467-028018 Yes. I think it's exaggerated. So, people on their own make
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-027760-027877 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-028043-028569 The idea it's very unsafe and not so much it's more the idealization, like of what they are thinking
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-028938-029039 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-028983-029221 They are making it more serious than it is.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-029267-029332 Yes, and West Philadelphia does have some bad areas, but it also has some very nice areas to stroll around.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-030156-030298 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-030192-030818 And there are people that live in Center City, that never used to happen, to come to have a stroll around here.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-030758-030874 That no.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-030839-031203 I think that it's a nice neighborhood.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-031233-031481 Yes, I don't dislike it at all
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-031470-031526 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-031531-031880 It's not particularly pretty, or nothing, but there's some good places to walk a bit
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-032673-032805 Live here as university student, if you want to be too far, you get disconnected from the university place and students
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-033447-033583 Yeah
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-034119-034281 Me too
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-034185-034251 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-034286-034463 The people that live in universities find it comforting
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-034529-034594 I kept going to Sesenta Street, then left.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-035201-035312 Oh Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-035216-035433 I wanted too see what was going on
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-035459-035590 And what did you find?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-035615-035964 And I found a poor, ugly neighborhood, a few old houses not taken care of.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-036783-036844 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-036798-037016 You could see it was poor, in a few places.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-037005-037081 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-037091-037228 There wasn't anything disgusting, or something scary, you could have seen
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-037824-037895 Right?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-038047-038138 Those kinds of neighborhoods usually make less income than others.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-038466-038653 Yes, they make a lot less.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-038628-038749 There are no white people in the street.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-039154-039240 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-039224-039780 The things that have surprised me the most avout Philadelphia are that the divisions are so large that there is still
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-039679-039983 Is that wan an impressing displacement is?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-039952-040200 Yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-040064-040129 It's impressing to see the further you go west there are more black people, and less whites.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-040938-041044 Yes, and sometimes I take teh bus here in front of my house, and sometimes, when I get on the bus everybody is black and hte bus goes like changing colors, no? As it continues advancing.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-042000-042065 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-042338-042793 When you go westbound
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-042697-043031 I have used the bus just one time. I recall of getting on.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-043354-043718 Everybody was black when Iwas going to the eas- to the west
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-043652-043905 It is strange
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-044026-044219 The fact that the majority of black people here, is of lesser income.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-045149-045406 Sure. It is a relationship with social class, No? more, tha something racial, it is clear, yes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-045695-045760 Yes, more than anything
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-046251-046433 Where you from Mexico?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-046417-046655 From the Mexico City.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-046736-046832 They say that it is dangerous
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-047029-047812 Over there is a lot more serious. It is not as bad here
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-047565-047641 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-047843-048485 It is very evident that there continues to be a lot of segregation of social classes.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-048293-048358 Okay.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-048515-048758 I am from, I have like an appearance that is much more, this, European, let's say. I am blond with white screen and light eyes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-049091-049208 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-049481-050067 And if I could walk through some unsafe neighborhood of Mexico.....
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-050052-050163 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-050133-050441 Be sure that I am not going to go out with a purse
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-050426-050567 Wow
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-050481-050673 It will take one hour to catch me.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-050835-050967 Aha
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-051073-051472 They might even kidnap me because it is more probable that they do that.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-051422-051755 That I had also heard. Kidnappings
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-051720-052099 Yes, it is impressive. Now, it is interesting, because of the kidnappings, who they kidnap. I mean, it is no longer because you are from a family
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-052402-052544 Ok
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-052458-052741 Whoever take him in a care, call it as express kidnapping
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-053095-053181 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-053504-054106 This will cost thousands of dollars, if you have it.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-054146-054237 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-054151-054616 The truth is, they can do very brutal things when they get desperate?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-054272-054434 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-054636-054884 It it terrible. I mean, in the end, also there has been too much social conscience regarding the citizens. Now they are starting to oppose that, do you understand me?
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-056294-056416 People testify the attacks, people now do oppose
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-056866-056957 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-056876-057361 There has been much more involvement because before there was nobody.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-057240-057750 People didn't do it before as they were afraid of report.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-057472-057588 The security system didn't work. So, someone declares a crime and
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-058321-058438 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-058559-058877 It was a lot of paperwork that I don't know-that didn't work
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-058887-059125 Yeah.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-058918-059004 You have been, well, let's say, a little bit more, well reaffirming the action, of, the policemen, and things like that
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-060045-060176 Mm
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-060106-060591 So people feel that there's more response to catch thieves and kidnappers.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-060940-061056 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-061056-061208 Before those reports
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-061218-061364 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-061309-061435 There was a march in Mexico a couple years ago
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-062001-062077 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-062082-062224 About one and half years ago. That was called the Silent March for the Security of Mexico, where everybody walked to
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-063149-063280 To the city Zocalo
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-063270-063401 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-063331-063684 And there were millions of people, it was crowded
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-063593-063679 Wow
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-063710-064074 You can see them.  Everyone is dressed in white and they are all in the streets.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-064033-064240 Wow, impressive
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-064185-064301 Then you can realize it is something socially needed. People are already
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-065135-065282 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-065186-065433 Much more attention to the security
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-065398-065600 No
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-065519-065757 Anything else
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-065605-065858 I don't know how is in Mexico. But, looks to me, the Tv
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-066556-066935 Causes fear because the news is local
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-066995-067071 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-067238-067723 Each robbery, they explain it in different ways, and then they explain it again and again
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-067516-067607 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-067754-067925 Actually
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-067794-068037 Too much sensationalism
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-068021-068542 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-068087-068153 Yes
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-068582-068679 And,
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-068598-068860 In Mexico no that much, because it is very excessive that
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-069664-069750 OK
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-069745-070104 Practically impossible to include every robbery.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-070053-070235 I wonder.
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-070144-070433 Every rape, I don't know
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-070352-070422 None
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-070453-070640 Besides every mugging there is, there are some that are really big, like a kidnapping
20051024_181110_329_fsp-A-071085-071140 Sure
20051024_181110_329_fsp-B-071206-071413 Very drastic kidnappings, or the case of the Juarez deaths, that are
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-000000-000139 Alex, Besy.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-000154-000423 It's Javier.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-000402-000485 Oh. Hello.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-000480-000810 Hello, how are you? I think this is good, I've never served as a jury but I'd like to do it someday, I don't know if you
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-001864-002199 I got a letter last year
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-002163-002308 Did you?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-002204-002550 To serve on a jury but I refused
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-002602-002695 I've heard that it's quite hard because, it causes lots of trouble
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-003588-003681 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-003666-003903 Maybe you have problems,they have your record, your info about Courts, it's safer that way
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-005080-005695 I don't know, serving on a jury it's dangerous because it depends on which case you are serving
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-006309-006444 I mean, it's a
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-006325-006418 I see.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-006444-006975 If you get a murder case or someone that sells drugs
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-007481-007569 Yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-007492-007678 How do they call it?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-007647-008044 Oh well, a drug dealer or something
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-007936-007998 I see. They can have friends, let's say he's guilty, so he can talk to his friends and say go after this person and kill his children
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-009196-009433 You are so right, they can say she looks like this.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-009800-009922 Yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-009919-010254 I mean, they can make your description and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-010255-010325 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-010275-010765 They can, that could happen too but, they say thatit's optional if you, they send you a letter
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-011669-011803 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-011669-011917 Is it optional or mandatory?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-012237-012623 No, I got a letter. I said no, but I sent a letter to doctor
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-012986-013120 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-013017-013142 Saturday and Sunday.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-014323-014488 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-014323-014611 They said it was okay for me to no serve on a jury
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-014824-015046 Sure, it's
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-014869-015121 That was last year, so
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-015087-015552 Friend of mine got a letter like that but he's working, from six in the morning to four in the afternoon so no, he said he
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-016120-016564 The manager of his company said he was someone who was not able to skip work. Correct?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-016877-017045 I guess he asked him for a letter.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-017401-017545 Exactly.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-017421-017535 He to be sent to the jury
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-017576-017731 Well, yes. But sometimes I think it would be find to attend, mostly is cases such as.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-018666-018903 Rapes of boys and girls
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-018872-018970 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-018913-019197 Yes, you can serve as a jury, and how's that? If you can tell if the person is guilty and.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-019724-020235 You can help justice be served quickly, so I think it will be good to serve on a jury.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-020227-020396 So yes, I wouldn't want to be on one.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-020762-020896 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-020791-020877 Because I cry a lot, and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-021041-021387 Today I cried.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-021376-021817 No, I don't want to see a video of something happening like a rape of a child.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-022177-022714 You wouldn't be able to stand it if it's really horrible stuff
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-022399-022776 No that's so terrible
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-022869-023339 Where were you sent, in which state?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-023333-023491 No, I live in Canada
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-023499-023865 You are living in Canada
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-023617-023860 Yes, and you?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-023870-024072 I'm in New York
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-024059-024155 Oh, aha.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-024175-024795 I was trying to tell you about a friend I had when I lived in Arizona.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-024237-024335 I see.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-024851-025177 Do they have the same system in Canada?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-025611-025915 Yes I think so
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-025936-026385 You see, that's good.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-026049-026137 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-026395-026561 I don't know how to tell you if the day is mine but we have to be careful?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-027537-027786 We have to be careful because they don't tell you what type of case until you have arrived
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-028745-029055 Or so you
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-028815-028990 Where does it have to be?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-029055-029648 I imagine that it should be a meeting or a section to say, explain the case
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-029648-030206 It is when everything is. You said yes, that you will do it.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-029829-030222 You are already involved.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-030206-030397 There, jury duty
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-030371-030893 There
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-030674-031146 Then I don't want to do it.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-031125-031487 No too late
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-031146-031522 They said yes.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-031523-031900 When it was your name, correct?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-031857-031928 Besy, there

20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-036160-036294 None

20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-037580-038024 Vancouver is not around Washington State?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-037895-038230 All
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-038024-038173 I had plans to go to Vancouver because there were some friends from Bolivia
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-038994-039103 Oh, aha.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-039030-039748 I lost the trail with them and I couldn't go, because they say to me life there is very calm, I am not sure if this is true.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-039635-039872 A person with whom I spoke before told me you will live in a paradise. I say: why?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-040672-040879 There are several islands all around and the Mar is very near and one can go to the United States.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-041189-041333 None

20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-045977-046200 No, how do you say that? Let's say you kill someone and they give you the death penalty.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-046915-047080 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-046941-047297 Is there in some state from there, that?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-047308-047514 What here in the United States?

20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-047535-047938 Of course, yes they give you the chamber penalty of gas
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-047979-048123 I was seeing in the news,that this woman killed her three children.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-048831-048965 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-048862-049275 She lives very close. not even two miles of distance from here. Like at one miles
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-049146-049358 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-049301-049435 My mother says they should kill her. I say it's better they put her in jail because she'll suffer more.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-050209-050550 The other people in jail know what she did and for that
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-050395-050623 Ya
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-050550-050777 I say that they're going to
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-050974-051454 Imagine that a serial killer that killed someone
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-051970-052580 And then? The gas chamber? They have to be punished, yes or no? A few years
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-052342-052667 And of course something that will not cause suffering because if you kill one and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-052672-052931 Yeah
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-053029-053447 They suffered ten minutes, but if they put him in jail the other prisoners
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-054056-054227 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-054134-054361 Poor thing
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-054330-054495 Yes, well, no...
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-054366-054681 People suffer.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-054650-055022 You can understand that?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-055022-055373 There you go, he's going to pay for what he did and
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-055435-055574 What he did. I don't know. why do the people that do that not
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-056230-056323 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-056344-056669 But then as I say not
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-056370-056705 What do you think. People are crazy
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-056726-056984 The people are crazy.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-056917-057051 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-056984-057325 And as I say here, it's getting hard each time you listen to the comments that Canada were more calm.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-057882-058172 Now, there something more calm
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-058203-058327 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-058316-058554 I imagine that health care of the United States is not as good or like
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-059473-059654 What do you call a card that they give you for health care? I don't know what it's called.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-059912-060413 I don't know Medicare or something like that here.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-060598-060864 I Medicare okay, that's it
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-060707-060882 Yeah.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-060903-061084 It's not great
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-061110-061296 Yeah, exactly
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-061146-061306 Or is it?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-061296-061419 And over there?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-061445-061631 I would say that it's good
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-061771-062003 It's more fair
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-061967-062261 Yeah, here it's more fair
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-062277-062462 Today, that's great
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-062287-062488 Then over there
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-062468-062850 Hey and what is the job market like here?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-062488-062607 Well they are looking for a lot of people to work construction
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-063619-063950 What kind of construction?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-063898-064316 I think it's for constructing buildings.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-064316-064456 Yeah.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-064332-064492 Yeah, and they asked in other states.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-064569-064889 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-064776-065230 Already, but if you have experience doing so build buildings or houses or something.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-065535-065685 Yes
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-065741-066175 I guess we can ask for a visa, or something. I do not know.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-066149-066397 Not because
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-066201-066428 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-066475-066908 I was hearing that this country, that Canada, needs a lot of people.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-067213-067435 At least in the province where I study. I heard on the news yesterday that they needed people to
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-068049-068235 For this to work on construction
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-068473-068824 There's an internet program where you accumulate points.
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-069376-069697 Can go to work and the government helps all
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-069711-069910 Where?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-069841-069981 Yes

20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-070450-070549 None
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-070585-070900 I'm half interested in doing that, right?
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-070895-070977 Yeah
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-071034-071194 Would be good
20051025_212334_337_fsp-B-071204-071323 Okay
20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-071359-071633 And have you ever had any problems with having to go to court for that?

20051025_212334_337_fsp-A-071870-071989 Yes.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-000005-000151 Hello?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-001656-001983 Hello? Sorry.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-001731-001912 No it's fine, what is your name, where are you from?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-002285-002501 John from New york
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-002471-002758 OK, my name is Jennifer, from New York
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-002526-002642 And you?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-002758-003040 OK, So we are going to start this thing, finish quickly.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-003327-003422 Yes, what was the topic? Did you hear it?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-003483-003664 We are discussing interracial marriage.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-004338-004439 I didn't hear it well
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-004610-004998 That was today's subject. So what do you think about interracial marriage?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-005436-005914 You are in love with someone.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-005743-005974 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-005949-006206 Yes. Marry whomever you want.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-006135-006377 OK, well I
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-006302-006739 No.  I do not think I car.  No one else should care either.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-006729-007167 They ask what, what we thought about if it is easier for certain races to get married
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-008154-008260 Not I
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-008154-008385 Blacks and hispanics, things like that, they wanted to know
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-008582-008798 I don't think that it is easier, but it is better. Because a Latin person with a Latina, it depends where you live, if you get married. If I am a Latino and I marry a black girl or something,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-009770-009865 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-009825-010087 In lots of places, probably lots of people will criticize
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-010097-010384 Yes, they always criticize. They do it if you get married.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-010389-010555 Yes.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-010605-010887 Yes, yes you are, if you marry a Spanish girl
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-010973-011194 Yes, but what race are you?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-011134-011501 My rather is Dominican.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-011491-011667 Mother?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-011501-011662 Both of them.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-011838-012080 Both Dominican fathers. Good, I'm Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-011939-012025 My husband is Puerto Rican too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-012286-012377 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-012312-012382 Then that was a problem, too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-012588-012880 With his
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-012624-012815 With his family, obviously, they don't like Dominican people too much
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-013127-013293 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-013182-013288 Yes, when you look around the race doesn't count too much because my husband says that too. If we go into details
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-014199-014385 It could be a family situation.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-014395-014481 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-014592-014728 In my family there are a lot of professionals, we're a lot more educated
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-015010-015156 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-015271-015513 Unlucky. In some economical things we are more stable. However.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-015835-016026 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-015951-016177 The only reason they don't like me, was that the last girlfriend was Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-016867-017214 And I'm from Dominican Partents, born here, raised here
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-017174-017380 Yes, I have some Dominican family

20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-022585-022872 That's what I think too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-022832-023244 I get it and for me it's no so big. Always when both are happy
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-023199-023446 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-023244-023778 I care less they are green or yellow
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-023662-023949 I went out with girls of different tyoes.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-024025-024342 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-024271-024412 They are..i don't know, I don't care. My first girlfriend was Dominican

20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-025006-025117 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-025449-025857 Because a have some family members of my own, that I don't get along very well
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-025459-025545 I have some friends ad they are Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-025862-026139 And I don't like them.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-026194-026401 But they say the are Dominican, they don't tell that around that they are Dominican, because they treat them bad.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-026848-026994 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-026859-027196 He rudely said, I have and they don't, because their family says that too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-027463-027699 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-027473-027815 They call them rude
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-027709-027926 She's two as well, right?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-027865-028026 They are quite nasty
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-027991-028187 Yes, but
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-028026-028474 They themselves feel ashamed to see, and I said that that does not need to make them feel ashamed because it is there in all races
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-028208-028389 But exactly.  I love telling people.  I tell them in my professional life.  I talk with all kinds of people and what I say is
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-029370-029597 Where are you from? I am Dominican.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-029511-029793 Yeah, I know one guy, ok

20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-030025-030080 I am a policeman
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-030432-030528 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-030488-030568 He has tattoos, with the Puerto Rico flag
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-030820-031087 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-031062-031132 I always thought he was Puerto Rican, until two or three weeks ago. When we made a barbeque to tell summer good-bye.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-032073-032234 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-032164-032662 He was talking there, and the wife was talking there, and something came up about him making a vow to the flag. I didn't know that, and they said he made the vows to the flag, that he was not Dominican and all that. And he made
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-032692-032823 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-033171-033432 He made himself a citizen here
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-033422-033488 Hm mm.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-033447-033911 He always said that he was Puerto Rican and changed his documents to tell that he is Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-033865-034026 But this is
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-033956-034182 Well, he was not born here. But he changed everything with the parents, and all that.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-034243-034610 He is your friend, but that is ignorance, because
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-034525-034922 Yeah, I said, but why did you do it, then he said, because those people have not, they don't talk to me. He doesn't
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-034640-034741 You know
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-034947-035255 He doesn't want to know anything Dominica, that is not like that because right now, there are Puerto Ricans who don't want to know anything from Puerto Ricans
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-035567-035843 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-035662-035879 For their life they say, I am Puerto Rican.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-035869-036040 It is that. No.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-035884-036100 THEY NEVER CHANGE WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULDS CHANGE IT
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-036065-036427 Exactly
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-036100-036246 I am Puerto Rican American
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-036518-036901 I'm sorry that is ignorance.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-036790-037092 I being Dominican, hey I am Dominican, because I cannot change it.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-037228-037439 That
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-037338-037978 He has been paying; he is from Puerto Rico and New York.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-037625-037802 And still you, being that they have nothing to do with that.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-038129-038194 Hm mm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-038159-038436 That doesn't change at all.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-038406-038667 Yeah I am working now
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-038667-038748 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-038692-038889 The Bronx is filled with Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-039342-039503 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-039463-039981 A lot of people think that Dominicans are gross or that they don't know anything.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-039885-040238 There's all classes, in all the races.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-040187-040449 There are more Dominicans than whites you could say.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-040429-040686 And now because of this you have Dominicans, that love to multiply.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-040832-040932 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-041053-041239 Have kids.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-041063-041250 The Puerto Ricans didn't say anything. The more Hispanics and Latinos that come in, the better.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-041723-041828 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-041738-042171 The little whites have a lot of Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-041838-042291 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-042211-042543 This one Puerto Ricans want to grab
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-042513-042775 But this
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-042553-042634 So.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-042800-042936 I feel like speaking English
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-043233-043565 I know, I'm getting up there too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-043550-043741 This is because the brother is a policeman here in Manhattan
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-043983-044174 Yeah.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-044073-044295 In my thirties and already I have a house. He and I work with investigations, but I work mostly with policemen.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-045463-045548 Yea
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-045513-045719 So that.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-045629-045734 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-045719-045795 Just a moment. Where are you from? Then they talked to me for a while after I helped them, Dominican people say things in front of me
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-047139-047466 They said oh yes, then blah blah blah, they tell me, oh where are you from? Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-047697-048055 Yes, I speak like Dominican like that
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-047738-047869 None
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-048055-048352 But in front of them, and the Puerto Rican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-048145-048412 Yes no
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-048352-048679 There are some people who keep talking until the other person gets the point!
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-049127-049394 Yes. No.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-049213-049414 We are talking in a group, it looks like he is Dominican, but I am talking with the group.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-049479-049716 Okay.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-049791-050003 Two or three dominicans with two or three Puerto Ricans.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-049927-050119 OK
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-050003-050229 We chat with whities
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-050129-050239 Yes, because
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-050229-050360 But
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-050239-050632 The difference is that you can criticize a person and describe it, like that Dominican in the corner.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-051156-051704 Because when I watch people on the street I know they are Dominicans because they have a flag
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-051176-051342 Okay.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-051704-051845 I am Dominican, I came
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-051835-052016 Yes exactly
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-051850-052036 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-052016-052218 Unfortunately, the worse Dominicans, the ones that do all the things, are always painted, they have tattoos
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-052691-052781 Yes like the
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-052741-052927 They have a shirt
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-052832-052988 Yes, like women.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-052973-053063 Yes
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-052988-053189 That from a distance for a reason.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-053144-053255 Yeah, that also, but we are not all like that. That is a funny thing because when I was in college that was, where are you from?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-054307-054473 New York, what ethnicity are you, I'm Dominican
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-054855-054921 All
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-055041-055273 I don't think so
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-055082-055213 Turn around
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-055293-055585 No, that one in unfortunately that's a trait we all have. But, still, it's the point of
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-056124-056406 Excuse me. The point is that we are, or because we have that attribute.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-056788-056959 Yeah,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-056869-057015 I don't mean that we are all the same.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-057221-057296 Yea
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-057226-057573 I have cousins that make me ashamed
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-057669-057744 No, I didn't mean it that way, I meant it with the back part
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-057815-057976 Let's go to the heart of it
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-058449-058565 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-058474-058756 They are like that, and have persons too
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-058666-058751 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-058756-058917 We are professionals and we do what we do, and pitifully ok, my grandmother had a nice bottom, and we all inherited
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-059667-059979 Right, it's like.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-059743-059949 But
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-059979-060171 So what, if they are sluts like you said
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-060347-060468 No
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-060387-060508 Puertorican,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-060498-060674 We all have one
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-060513-060755 Dominicans, hell yeah!!
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-060699-061001 Yeah, but I don't. That's such a simple thing. You know you are Puerto Rican, I am Dominican,
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-061354-061696 My family with their own cousins
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-061802-061968 Oknow
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-061892-062179 I know that for a fact
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-062003-062255 But what kill me is that we're so close in proximity
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-062491-062592 Yeah
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-062491-062733 Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are what, like niety miles apart? We're closer than Florida and Cuba.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-063040-063125 Yea
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-063110-063488 And we hate each other just because of where we were born- what is that?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-063402-063483 Yeah. It's because some say, oh, Dominicans think they're better than us, and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us. Like that.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-063951-064348 Exactly, but you know
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-064097-064218 That's all starts, even in the computer checking out the chatrooms
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-064354-064645 Thinking..
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-064635-064882 We're fighting like crazy
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-064832-065194 I never deny my race, but I usually don't tell people until I'm asked
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-065421-065582 The reason why I part asked you why you're from New York
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-065758-065949 (utterance only)
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-065929-066125 What part of New York? Because you sound white.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-066266-066548 Get out of here
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-066312-066624 Yeah, you sound like white.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-066563-066860 Thank you so much, I speak Spanish like a white person, too?
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-066795-066865 But nothing of course. Not now, let the Spanish come out.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-067016-067213 Let me find out, okay? That's another thing that bothers me. What does it mean to some white
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-068330-068421 Like
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-068365-068798 You know what I'm saying
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-068421-068914 I told you I'm from the Bronx, I thought that they were going to hang up, because I had three callers, I told them I'm from the Bronx, and they hung up.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-068798-068874 I wonder.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-068914-069045 They hang up on me
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-068989-069281 No abs-please, I'll tell everybody I don't care.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-069156-069427 In Florida's Disney World
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-069312-069422 Hm mm
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-069427-069629 It was a line, and we were standing. A few said, Excuse me, because the line was moving but some other people weren't moving.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-069830-070041 I see
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-069926-070268 And I had, I said Bronx New York, and they  honey, come on, they're from the Bronx, and they moved, and they got off the line like
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-070605-070812 Out embarassed
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-070786-071068 No, it's not your fault
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-070827-070998 I was like, oh well.
20051026_180724_341_fsp-A-071068-071255 Not your fault, people act ignorant around me all the time, and say stupid things like that
20051026_180724_341_fsp-B-071798-071919 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000010-000090 Hi?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000106-000176 Yes. Hello?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000197-000328 Hi, good night
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000323-000449 How are you
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000490-000626 Who am I talking to?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000631-000717 David
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-000758-001112 Oh, David.  It's Joe, or Joseph
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-000869-000925 How are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-001243-001541 Where do you live?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-001536-001870 Here in Connecticut, I already spoke with you last week.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-001754-001809 How are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-002016-002133 It was cut off the call
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-002274-002481 I don't know why
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-002461-002648 I don't know why it was cut off
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-002532-002603 I don't know what they are going to do with that
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-002679-002770 Howdy, How are you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-003007-003361 So much calls that, had been cut off. And, it seems that also
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-003422-003482 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-003674-004129 There is a lot of people that, there is so many calls that they haven't processed.Therefore, it seems to me that they don't know how many valid calls
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-004690-004994 Have every person. Therefore, I don't know what they are going to do. Because, already, are a to much people that, by example, my mother already have reach the twenty five calls
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-005029-005120 Yea?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-005484-005651 There were several calls that did not cut out, so she doesn't know what to do.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-006212-006495 But they still can call you, or no?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-006475-006834 They still call her. They called her two weeks ago and yesterday.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-007364-007693 They pay her just for twenty-five, right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-007657-007804 I think so. It's just that, in the end, it doesn't seem very well organized to me. And it surprises me, because
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-008754-009265 They've done that lots of time because the LDC did it a year and a half ago.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-009553-009695 Yes, to do it in English right.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-009558-009649 But before, yes. It was in English, but they also had it in Arabic, and in Spanish, and whatever. But that's already an old story. They've already done it lots of times, or at least once.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-010857-010918 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-010989-011378 I  don't know now because it is wunndly all new to me again; but, at that time for several months...
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-011560-011914 Yes.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-011686-011747 No,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-011984-012283 It's pretty clear because the other time they had the topic it was about religion.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-012763-012834 And they were like fifteen or twenty days it was all the same topic.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-013258-013551 I know. No and not just the recorder that I think was a type of computer or something else they had there.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-014385-014451 Yeah.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-014461-014679 And they tell her , that's my theory, that what they were saying was they write the text in English, for what they wanted for her to say
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-015639-015806 You could hear it, right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-015791-015882 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-015806-016084 Then, they went to the auto-this, translator, then, they put the text there.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-016099-016170 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-016463-016609 There are computer programs that do that from English to Spanish
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-017706-018080 Put a lot of text then the computer reads it.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-018075-018202 Right,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-018202-018652 No, the translator was something like this type, I imagine.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-018323-018379 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-018652-018889 What it talked about
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-018677-018737 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-018889-019182 Imagine that it was a computer.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-019172-019344 Of course.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-019182-019698 It did not only have a bad accent, but everything it said when the calls ended.  It said........
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-020057-020244 Your time is above.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-020279-020719 No, I haven't seen it often, because when
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-020613-021103 No, I didn't either. I never checked until various times that I heard it, I didn't understand anything.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-021482-021558 Yes.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-021497-021856 One time the topic was Dating
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-022549-022675 Then,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-022584-022685 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-022685-022893 The translation in Spanish was to date. That way, how do you like to date it? Things like that are
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-023994-024085 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-024005-024080 Incredible. Obviously they have people who speak Spanish? I don't know.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-024768-025021 But it depends
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-024930-025172 I has not been very well organized
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-025182-025865 If you send them an email they answer you the next day
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-025551-025668 Shudong, yes. But, the good thing is that they pay well. One is a little annoying having to answer
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-026881-027058 It is not a big deal.  And they pay well.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-027204-027492 Yeah, but with me, the other time I did it and it was over.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-027750-027801 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-027755-027831 They didn't call me again and didn't have a phone number to call them  but they sent me a check
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-028584-028660 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-028604-028908 You know, about sixty days ago, maybe two months ago, and they sent me a check.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-029069-029135 NA
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-029282-029550 Until I forgot it, I never knew.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-029560-029843 A surprise,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-029787-029949 And do you live in Philadelphia?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-030146-030399 Yes in Philadelphia, my mom lives in the outskirts. I live here, in West Philly.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-030894-030980 Okay.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-030970-031162 At the University. Then,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-031177-031374 You live in the outskirts too, don't you?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-031187-031329 That's here, sir.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-031450-031713 You guys go to Penn State?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-031663-031865 All the world is confused by University of Pennsylvania because Penn State
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-032689-032987 Is located in the center of the state
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-032719-032795 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-033007-033346 It is a public University.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-033356-033417 Right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-033391-033604 Yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-034013-034205 Ah in two different
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-034185-034695 Yes exactly, that is private, and is located in the city it is completely different. The other is much bigger and is public it is the countryside
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-035034-035302 Yes, those that are and another thing like that. No?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-035322-035489 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-035701-035838 Where the wilds are. No?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-035939-036419 I don't know. I have never gone there, I don't know exactly where it is.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-035964-036045 Over there.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-036419-036697 What is that in the center? Well, maybe in the eighty one, possibly, but although the eighty one I think will be more.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-037379-037460 Possibly because I know the 81 well.  It's better I say nothing.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-038446-038582 For mine it is the same
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-038456-038830 All that I know of the eighty one is that we used to live in Tennessee
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-039103-039219 Northeast
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-039149-039341 Alright
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-039240-039452 So we were living in Virginia, but then we moved to Tennessee. Then we found out that the eighty-one passed through there, but that's all I know.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-040139-040261 Oh, Okay
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-040311-040402 It seems like it's long highway
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-041459-041631 I wish I could work, I wish I could go to school.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-041646-041721 Okay
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-041924-042171 But im,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-042060-042318 It's a lot easier to imagine
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-042247-042601 Yeah, some people don't think about it, but when you're at school, that's where you find friendship. You don't have to go out to talk to your friends.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-043187-043445 Not, The whole world relies in the center.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-043445-043566 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-043475-043981 Then one is done, and has to go home, and has to pay the, the costs of the house, it's really hard, it's better to stay at school.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-044289-044618 The good thing about being in university is when someone is done, one cost's rise.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-045159-045578 A lot, so, fixed payments, fixed responsibilities. I don't know.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-046058-046190 You need to try.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-046518-046751 A lot
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-047049-047155 No.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-047110-047287 No, the ramen soup costs twenty cents.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-047540-047696 Yes.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-047681-048424 If one could live off of ramon soups, it would only cost twenty five cents to eat dinner, but then again, it isn't that way.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-047696-047787 Yeah.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-048429-048692 You don't spend much less, but it's a calmer life but I think too that when the people remember when they were students, forget everything else. So in the workplace really?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-049809-049925 Sure
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-049885-050097 It's a life that has more freedom, flexibility in time.  For example, if I want to spend tonight
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-050790-050987 Every night I'm awake studying. And if I have class the next day, I don't really care. Because some days, I don't have class, or I really don't want to go to the class.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-051967-052180 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-052038-052493 But at work you can't say I didn't want to go to work today
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-052453-052695 Yes, it doesn't happens
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-052513-052665 Only that yes, no it's very flexible
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-052756-052837 No, your skills
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-053267-053337 None
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-053272-053585 In life, when you go out to school everybody calm down, you know, they have family
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-053964-054379 They have children, and the life is more harder
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-054394-054556 Because the work, responsibilities you have
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-054515-054894 I can tell you how to live the American dream.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-055238-055657 The American dream, they want to buy a house, etc.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-055253-055334 Yes.  I think the trouble is you're not happy with what you have.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-056825-056992 So, one has to buy a car, and you want one and then another. So then one would have to start working, right? In order to maintain yourself, while a student just lives there.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-057998-058119 But at the same time,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-058003-058079 Right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-058180-058559 Everything that one consumes, goes to buy for a better car and one may do one thing and the other. And then when one sees, the money is gone right? And one stays there, it looks to me only with the responsibilities. Right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-059666-059727 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-059671-059818 Right now I am happy as a student, but for now. Right? But eventually, of course, one has to save to buy a house
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-061031-061410 I don't know. That is scary to me, having so many overheads. Because that one works, and works, and works.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-061435-061501 Yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-061703-061779 One doesn't think of all the benefits of having money
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-062759-062987 It seems like a lot when one has to have the car to go to work and the other has to cut the grass.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-062997-063108 Right, yeah
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-063614-063730 Let's say a sample.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-064210-064574 You are more responsibilies in life.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-064574-064766 Definitely
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-064604-064726 But in life of being poor, it is more difficult.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-065034-065191 Yes, right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-065069-065747 The life of being poor has nothing to do. If you want to work, you work; if you don't want to work you maintain it.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-065711-065959 That is right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-065868-065964 You know
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-065959-066202 The wife maintains him.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-066121-066343 More or less
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-066232-066328 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-066363-066823 You have to get one, one good woman, that could help you, who has, a house, or an apartment, who helps you, for this and that. But,
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-067359-067465 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-067390-067678 No, but life is like this, no?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-067673-067764 Yes
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-067678-067794 Live and learn
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-067804-067930 I think so, that because of that, one has to be careful 
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-068679-068840 How do you spend money? It is very easy. For example, when you buy a house, then buy another house, and another. People don't understand anything. You feel that don't and aren't going to enjoy money. Right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-069775-069922 You have to be serious to see
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-069780-069846 Right
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-069932-070175 What is more important. Right? What is it that you like to do?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-070215-070276 Right. No.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-070458-070872 And if not that. Then, it is better not to spend money on that. Right?
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-070908-071231 Tell me the large companies that are giving you stuff.
20051026_211309_346_fsp-B-070918-071034 That is what it seems to me
20051026_211309_346_fsp-A-071231-071661 Don't you see that big companies give you cars, no money down? They give you the stuff
