Hello
Hello.
Who is this?
How's it going, this is Guillermo. How are you?
Guillermo
Yes
This is Jos√©.
How's it going, where are you from?
I live here in Philadelphia.
In Philadelphia.
Yes, and you?
I am peruvian. I am studying in the University of Pennsylvania.
Oh, what do you study?
I study history
Oh I am also a student here, I'm a senior
What university?
University of Pennsylvania
Oh yes
Yes. I'm almost done here okay?
That's good
But
You are studying?
I'm in Wharton.
None
If it's business, then you are a student for a PhD. The masters is exactly that.
Undergraduate
I'm an undergraduate
None
But these hours here
Sorry?
Did you live in Peru?
I'm sorry as you say
Did you live in Peru?
I was living in Peru until three months ago
None
Clearly
Then you're a freshman
I studied at the University of Peru for two years and then I transferred. that is I'm an international transfer
You're not an exchange student, you're a transfer?
It is clear I will graduate with a degree from this university
That is good.
As opposed to an, exchange student
That's good. What do you think so far?
It's a bit hard to tell you the truth
Yes, is it of English
Yes.
All the work
It's more difficult to express myself in English than in Spanish.
Yes
It is very clear to me.
Yes
Because of the amount of work that they send me
More than in Peru?
Yes, they send you more
None
More than in Peru. Even in the last cycle, in Peru, in my university I took six classes. One semester.
None
I think I had less work than what I have now, taking five classes.
None
I'm taking five classes, but I also work.
Okay
Maybe that's equivalent to taking six classes or something.
Yes.
It's a little less, I don't think it's so demanding as taking six classes
Yes, it's still pretty intense.
Yes, maybe in the future I decide to
Yes, it's hard
I'll decide to take less classes, I don't know. How many courses do you take per cycle, more or less?
It depends. In general, five, but sometimes I think, it's just four, last cycle I only took four, but now I'm taking five
And you
But, in general, people in College only take four
I see
In Wharton people generally take five
Do you work?
None
Are you a full time student?
I have a little job at the library but it is not really a job because when i am there
I study.
It's very advantageous. What do you do in, I also work in the library, but I'm a shelver
None
So, really it doesn't give me the chance to study.
I did that sometimes but no but, in, what are you doing? What part of the library? In
In the fifth floor of Van Pelt
Okay
Where do you work?
In Lippincott
Where's that?
It's the library at Wharton.
Yea
It is on the second floor where i work for five to ten hours a week
There's only a little bit more than a month of work left
There's more people who need help
None.
I do not have a lot of work
None
But yes, what I've seen is that, for example, sometimes in Latin America, but you saw that in Europe,
In the universities, in general, there's not a lot of work just until the end so the professors
In England, for example?
In Europe in general, really,
I've heard that too, the number of hours that you have in class each week,
None
They are less than three
None
Then you have a lot of free time.
Yes,
Aside I think yes, they don't give you much work, no, I'm not sure
They don't give them much work but in general they want that
Yes, they are doing exercises and they continue doing all.
Of course
In the end they give an exam and that is the grade.  In the United States it's
Different true. Because here, especially in history, one has to investigate, then an essay, then another.
Hmm
That is the best in the sense that there are less risks
That is an advantage, no truth that there are less risks
The work, yes, but...
Because, imagine that for example you go to decide your exam grade. All of a sudden the night before you couldn't sleep
Whichever may have happened
Yes
You may have prepared  but it didn't go well in the exam
Yes
I mean your grade
Yeah,
Your grade goes down
There's all the work they give you every week.
Another job
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Every system has it's advantages. How's it like in Peru in general?
Let's see, I would say they also make us work, we have like an equivalent to midterms
None
But they are mostly reading controls.
None
Through the semester
None
At the end of some courses, you're also asked to deliver a research paper.
None
You also have a final exam.  You don't have to produce as much as you do here.
None
I mean, you don't have to write much.
Right.
Here they're constantly making you write papers and reviews right?
Yes
There isn't much more than what you wrote to offer to the investigation.
None
In the final semester. No you didn't have to produce much.
None
That could be advantageous in the sense that they don't ask you much
One can live more relaxed.
Yes
The point is it's to your disadvantage not to come. You don't get to constantly practice your labor
Investigation, and neither about how to describe right, I mean sometimes one for not writing much, one loses ease, write. So
None
I would tell you that it's easier.
Yes
They form it so well like they form it here.
Yes
But it has a cost hat here they make form you better, it's good but, at least, me , for example, this final weekend, I am full of things to do, so
I live a little more anxious
Yes
Stressed
Yes.
I don't know how Wharton might be
Yes, it is different because in Wharton, it also depends because, for example, classes I take in general don't have
Like essays or research, only in general, two, three exams, and, and that's it. But there are classes for example that have more that well, you have the two exams, but you also have projects.
OK.
These case studies
The persnonal or group products
In groups since in those days almost everything was in groups. And if they give you homework, you had to review the little thing, because otherwise
Because, and I like it like that, for example, every week you have homework, a small one you have to turn in, because, that way,
They make you study every week.
Of course
Yes, I like that they do that, but in general they are exams or projects.
NONE
Each class always has an exam. I have never had a class where there were only projects. In general, two exams and maybe one project.
None
In the marketing class we have, a project is and I don't know how they did it
They created a whole piece of software that is a simulation
You have a group
None
Each group is assigned
None
This company has several products. You have to decide, based on each product, where we are going, what kind of
How are we going to see this product, we are going to
That is interesting.
Of course is not like in the real life
It resembles
Sometimes writing things as an essay helps you understand it better.
The mistakes
None
There are may things like that, too. Then everything depends on the course.
None
Yes, here there is and I hardly write anything in general. Then it looked pretty weird that I had to write
Yeah
Have you been living long here in the United States?
How come?
Too much cold here, right?
Yes, I think it was on Tuesday, at night, that was raining
Yes
I got frozen, yes.  I have to go with my coat.  I bought a coat that shelters a lot
Not yes
I always go out with it. Sometimes even using the coat, I get cold. Inside my room it is more
None
Manageable the matter of inside the dorm the temperature is good enough
None
Warm, right.
In Peru there are parts where it gets really cold.
Well right yes if you go to the mountains
None
The winter nights in the mountains are really cold
I see.
I remember going to the mountains in Peru on vacation with my family at night.
It could even get colder then the cold i've experienced here
Hello?
Hello, my name is Glori.
Hello, Gloria. I am Paulina. Where are you calling from?
From New York.
New York. I am in Georgia.
From Long Island.
None
From Long Island
Long Island
None
I am in Athens, georgia
From Georgia,
How is it?
I didn't understand what she said.
What?
Something about religion. She said she talks
You didn't understand what she said.
No
She was talking about the religion, what is the opinion about religion, if it unifies people, or separates them, all the people should belong to the same religion.
I am catholic. So I believe it joins some and separate others. For example I have a nephew that is gay.
They are Catholics, they don't accept gay people,
None
God made us all unique
People never believe that they are born that way but her was.
Has a lot of problems with the Catholic religion, because they don't accept him and he knows he's not accepted. So, he finally found a church, in the thirty-two, in New York, that accepts homosexuals.
If people would stick to their religion, there wouldn't be that many problems. They wouldn't go to extremes. Every religion
None
If people would follow Jesus Christ's teachings and act like He did
None
There wouldn't be a problem.
None
He did not teach us to start fighting.
None
None
Exactly.
That's when trouble arises.
None
The same thing happens to Muslims.
None
The principles of that religions teach us
None
They are good things. But, when people become fanatic and don't accept other people, you respect differences,
None.
I believe when there is division, there are problems.
Yes. Like, this, what was I going to say? At lunch time, I, to the girls where I work three,
I take a little book by Joyce Myers, and everyday scriptures. And, I read them, then, they tell me, that is shit, that I say, but
Listen what she is saying and like you would like to treat you because i dont have to treat her well
I dont like her, but everybody is created in the image of God.  We start to fight, then I say look, I want peace because what happens is that everything
We talk about today's subject. Forget it, one has been made, but still they look for me. To read, everyday.
Great
Because, there is one that is like a firecracker, and I was telling her that I don't want to hang out with her because she drains
All my energy. She is always criticizing everyone. I don't want to be in this environment. She says I read to her everyday. The other days she is saying
She is thankful to God and is always reading about it
I say, that is the only thing that has saved my mind because, otherwise, if I start to criticize, that everybody criticizes me, and I know that I am a good person, and that God just like I am,
I would have already jumped out a window if I allowed people to influence me.
Yes
He needed some kind of tension of emergencies
None
Yes
In one on one relationships, or like a people, let's say what happens in Israel, amongst the
None
Between the Palestinians, and the
Yes.
And the Jews.
None
It's sad, and they go fighting
Yes.
Because for the two there are sacred places, but they don't respect.
None
Other people
My friend went to another church [than Catholic]. She tells me,
I say you have to find the church  that you believe, that fits you.
I'm not going to tell you that you should go to the Catholic church, if it's not giving you anything because I go to Catholic church.
She found another church, she tells me maybe you should go with me.  I say no I go to where I'm going.  I like it more there.
I am going to charismatic groups. I like to go to other churches, I'm not going to say that I don't go, but I don't want that she
Now I have been to that church back many times. and it takes all day Sunday, and I don't have the whole day on Sunday to be there
Three hours, four hours.
Yes
None
What religion goes, is your friend?
I believe it's something like Christian Science.
None
Yes. They are like born again Christians, or something like that.
Yeah.
Yes, something like that. So, then you know she was Catholic. But, the husband goes to the Catholic Church. In my house, the only one going to church is me. I don't think she likes to go, she always fights with me when she goes.
I twelve.
Of Katrina, and he says, aye, God made that, which
None
I tried hard to convince him that it was not an act of God but couldn't.
Od himself, He does not allow them, even though the Bible said that a lot of those things would occur. I was telling him to maybe read the Bible, it will show you what there is.
Yes.
None
I find that, regarding religion, many people go solely by tradition
Nonoe
When one goes and finds the truth,
None
There one finds a religion.
Yeah.
Many people do not know what their own religion is about
They sit there, and once the Father is finished, they leave.
Yes, they don't study what's written for themselves or anything.
Yes.
Yes. Help when we start studying, who would believe, it's your own religion.
Yes, I am going to a charismatic group and I can speak Spanish but can't read or write it.
They gave me a Hispanic bible and I am reading it. I explain to them what I read.
They read in English to see if I can understand it. The Bible is much too difficult.
The vocabulary in the bible is difficult no matter what language its in.
I find it difficult so they give me some passages and they tell me what it means
I've adopted it into our lives for a better understanding
Where are you from?
I am Puerto Rican.
Where you born in the United States
Yes.  I was born in Puerto Rico but I grew up in New York.  In what they call 'el barrio', in East Manhattan.

Yes
I lived in Manhattan, then I lived in Bronx, and now I moved to Long Island and we stayed here. Even though, when we retured, we are going to live, I guess
In Florida. Because, my oldest son, and my grandchildren live in Florida.
So then you will go
So, I like to go. I would like to go to Florida to be close to them. But by the time that I go my grandson will probably be married.
I will retire in ten (10) years.  He will be 27 and may be married.
Maybe, somewhere else, yes.
I am going to be OK.

I have the the bodysuit, but
Yes
The head belongs to my friend. Then, her and myself make the party. Then, sometimes they request two, and we could not go. It can only go one person
None
So I am trying, my friend is making it, but the head is very heavy. So, I cannot even imagine how we are going to make that head.
I thought that this is why I could not hear what you were telling me, madam.  I am doing a lot of things.  I should concentrate.
Everyone at the same time, yes
I do not know why they argue the same thing
Yes?
Have you been doing this for a long time?
I've done, I think ten, eleven.
Oh, like me, yes. Something like that, yes.
Yes not so much
Okay, yes.
The last time that I did was of politics. I don't remember what it was.

Yes I find it easy.
Did you get your citizenship or not?
The home is because I have one. More than four years of marriage
Yes
Then
But after three years of marriage you can apply for Citizenship
Yes, what happens is that I have a double-citizenship. I have my citizenship in Venezuela. I have my Italian citizenship.
Because my father is Italian.
Do you speak Italian?
Yes.
Yes
If I accept the American citizenship, I'll have to.
Quit now
Citizenship.  That's not good for me
Currently in Chile we have double citizenship. It could be American citizenship
The problem is I have two. They won't let you have three.
You're right
Yes
It's a little complicated
Yes
They're no. Are you happy with the residence? your parents are
See

My parents live in Venezuela. My dad was born in Italy.
Are your grandparents and uncles in Italy?
No, from my dad's side, they are
In Italy, I have some friends who live in Rome

None
Beautiful, and do you own any animals, dogs, cats or something like that?
No, we don't have any because we live in a apartment.

Yes, do you have animals?
Yes, I have dos, I have a cat.
None
I have plants and aquarium in house.

Yes
A garden or anything
You can take them out for a walk. I used to live in an apartment, I moved here about five months ago. I've been here for three months with the dog, the cat, the plant
I used to take my dog out for a walk outside.
We want to have a puppy.
Yes.
We don't want to leave the poor puppy locked up in the apartment all day long.
None
This is the question we are thinking of moving to this.
Yea? Your husband is from here, the United States ? Or from Venezuela ?
No, he's from the United States.
Few that are going to change soon.
If we are waiting to buy a house close from here
To move
If so we can move and thus be able to find a puppy or anything else.
For this and not feel like we moved out one month ago. To me, this is my home from where I'm talking.
We had to close the yard and place cartons all around to have the hill just outside. It is so small and the dog is a labrador.
Exactly.
Then, it can enter and leave the garage but it has the gate opened and a space where it can walk, run and play.
I want it if it can enter and leave freely then it can play in the yard
NONE
Runs all around, exercising
You have another idea? What kind of puppy do you want?
Yes, if you are thinking of a reason why
It's very little.
Not like the medium ones.
Which are ?
But I know that they look like teddies.
Yes, I know which ones, they are pretty and colored

None
I do is, find music online
Okay.
I have around five hundred CDs that I have bought
None
I have looked for a lot of them online
Exactly.
So what that for me, well it's for me, I need music for everything, I need it for when I work, when I study
Music is extremely important.
It's substantive
Exactly
It helps me to concentrate, to relax. I find music for me can help me change my mood. Yes, I can be
Exactly
Very calm and yes I listen to a song that can put me in a bad mood or the same I could be in a bad mood and can listen to a song that makes me happy
Yes, I play my instrument, and my husband plays his instrument at festivals and things like that.
Okay.
There is a bar very close to my house where many people come to play every night. Nothing people seit [?] no to, and to play instruments
There are open circles every night. There are songs where the people pay. One the weekends they come here different musical groups
To play every night and on the weekends.  It is very cool
What is your favorite type of music?
I like everything.
Is there any type of music that you don't like?
I like at least that I don't like that way, that if rap hip hop or at least music, pop
So that if Britney Spears and not that, I don't like it, it doesn't strike my attention at all
Okay.
I like a lot at least rock in Spanish, I have a lot of rock in Spanish and bluegrass music So
Okay, do you have a favorite group?
I like, at least from rock in Spanish, I like Fito Paez a lot
Okay.
That is from Argentina
Yes
Yes, I like it a lot
Okay
He does not believe that God is helping him everyday.
That
The one who died was a very good singer but more or less there are many people who play
None
Many of ours friends that play and sing and have bands
Yes
They are very good
Okay. well for me I only go to one or two concerts each year
But in general the type of concert I'm going to is more rock, in English, and the people that go are more
Younger and and as it is, they are too scandalous. So for that I didn't pay too much attention to going to concerts for that.
None
I was at a concert of Willy Nelson
None
And Bob Dylan
Yes
It had people of every age, there were people that were sixty or seventy years old, and kids that were barely ten or eight years old in the concert.
Yes
Yes, good. It was held in a small baseball stadium and there weren't so many people there because of that.
Very good concert
You  have many CD's?
We buy music more than anything but also we bought a lot of music from groups that are not very popular, of people we know
Yeah.
Yes, because we are members of one of folk music societies of Philadelphia, then at least there are many musicians
Who are members. There are concerts in the homes. They do this every month.
Ok.
There was a concert and we bought those CD's
Ok.
We see groups that are not so super but they are good
Ok.
Sometimes we have seen groups
And
They did not know they were famous and suddenly we're in a festival
Yeah.
We hear a famous song suddenly
Ok.
But
Ou say you play instruments, you and your husband play in a band or group?
No. My husband played in a group before, They are not together in that group, probable, they will be together again
Okay
No we don't play in a group. My husband sometimes plays with friends. We don't have time.
To compromise ourselves with other people
Okay
Because of the job, it doesn't give us time to compromise ourselves that way, because if you have a group, you have to practice for at least one day
Practice and find that
Week
The promotions and
Okay
Yeah
A group is an option for you if you do not have a lot of time.
Where do they get together on Wednesdays around ten, they practice until like 2 in the morning.
Does he work, or study? How does he have time for that?
Yeah, we try, for example, knowing who they are before we go to a movie
I like music its good for me
I remember lots of songs from
None
Songs that I can let years pass by without listening to anything else. I could keep singing those kind of songs years after years
That happens to me. Whenever I have not listened to a song for a long time, I forget the lyrics. The other day, I was talking to a friend
And she was with her, we listened to a song on the radio that i didn't hear in about eight years, but she remembered the entire song.
They played a song that I had listened to.
I knew the song but I couldn't remember the words to the song, but I remembered a little,
If I don't listen all the time I forget the words, I know the song, but I forget the words a little.
It depends on the mood I'm in
But I have an Ipod. You know what Ipods are?
None
I have like ten thousand songs in the Ipod.
None
I have a list of music that only has music for the dance music.
I have a complete list that is only rock in English that is what I use when I do to the gym.
Exactly
I have a spanish classical music things like that
For relaxation.
And for studying
To study I can't have that type of music, I can't have classical music, I need music...
Yes?
If there are no lyrics, I get bored. I need something to distract me.
What are you studying?
I work with virus.
Okay.
Biology.
Okay
I always need something that distract me, that keeps me alert
Exactly.
I put music but not classic
None
I put on classic music when I have to write a report or when I have to concentrate a lot.
Then, even since I was a little kid always, when I had to study, I always was hearing to music while singing, I could be reading and my dad always criticized that
Is impossible for a person to read and sing at the same time but it always worked with me I always got good grades
I suppose that
I had a teacher
Not
When you are studying something, if you sing it you will learn it
Faster than the normal
Yes that doesn't attracts me to the music
Hello
Hello, you are speaking with Fabiola
They connect you and it works.
Yeah, and that's how it was working and they pay you

These kids must have not been here
The best thing that has happened to me was meeting my husband
Yes, how
And the second best thing that has happened to me was having my kids
Yes
Be healthy and staying healthy.
Yes, because if I had not met the boy, I wouldn't be here.
In reality
Another wouldn't have these kids, I wouldn't have known you either
Yes
If it had not been for
Why not? A good topic to talk about is music.
Yes
Yes, and it is entertaining; you talk for twelve minutes and they cut you off
Well here me I like them
Yes they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye
None
And even though we have twelve minutes to talk about what we want, because they are starting to recognize our voices
What is this called
The idea is to talk because the entire conversation is recorded
After the computer knows that
Who is who
For the accent
It's the form of speaking.
None
The stamps I have and they are inventing something
Yes for the
Then they need people that have different voices
No idea, and I hadn't called because I would say no you can't call
And the
Much earlier
The girls all using this number
Yes
Yes they call each other at once, at the same time
None
And they connect well
I am going to try then to call after a little later or in the middle of the day.
Yes but I don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
In the same day
I can hear the voices of the beautiful kids.
They are here
I can hear it very clear
They are both laughing
They are, and what are you doing for them to laugh?
They're sitting on my lap and they looked at each other and laughed.
They look and laugh, and say you look like me, no no you look like me.
One has a lollipop so he throws that lollipop onto him, while they are there.
They are interesting, they are growing, do you talk to them?
None
Do you talk to them now?
How?
Do you talk to your kids?
Yes, I talk to them when there's time
In the English?
In Spanish
None
And in english?
In English because they are going to know different languages.
Yes, that's why they grew up with two languages
Yes
They also grow up with not having an accent
Imagine me with Geni with two languages. She speaks both languages, she can read both languages. Nevertheless, she has an accent and has trouble with Spanish.
None
She is three years old.
None
When she was two and a half months old I took her to Chile
Where did she learn how to talk? she learned to talk when she was in Chile? yes

None
We used to come here on vacation every year and one month here
None
Her father always spoke English to her
She was confused
When she would hear him, she would hear a very bad Spanish from Michel
None
Bad English from me
None
Now I speak better English. Michel speaks better Spanish and can read both languages, but she gets confused.d
Speaks with a strong accent
I speak in Spanish but the bad thing is that when I'm with another person and they speak English
I spoke to them in English
But isn't that bad?
It is bad but it is not at the same time, because my accent is not understandable.
No, it is not good.
And I know that they are very little now they are not going to, are not going to but that oh the same all of this is being engraved since
Yes. From the time they are four months old children begin to
Is that

None
And for Jenny, not yet; I am still looking for something for her. There is something she likes a lot, a Gameboy but a new one
None
You do not use keys. Touch the little things and it moves.
Yes
One super new that came out
None
I would put that one for her because that's what she wants.
What did you give for her birthday
And a karaoke
A karaoke, and do you play with it or not?
Yes, it sings. It is good because at her age she is reading. As she reads, the letter get darker and change color.
None
She sings the song
None
Yes, it keeps her entertained, and it is good for her to read faster. That is great for Christmas, and my father-in-law
I bought a gift for Jonathan
None
That is one
For the
For the computer, it has to move the mouse
None
Move the mouse and it has a calculator
The mouse has a calculator?
The part where you move the mouse is a small square
That little plastic thing
And that
Okay.
So that I bought one for me and one for us on the part of Jonathan
None
Believe that
They are going to be here for Christmas or are they going
We will leave for Arkansas for a week
A week.
Every year we go for a week
Oh, I Cristina told you the other time that they are thinking about going to Chile for work
Yes
It won't function
No, but it still has not begun.
But she said that at least all the things
It is not true
None
They told her/him they have the personnel.  If anything happens, they'll let him/her know
Yes
That's how we later call you
Something like that
It turns out that he/she hasn't started the job in Chile.
None
I got excited. I told Michael, if we get it, we go
He would go
Michel, yes.
None
How can we not go if recently we bought the house?
None
We sell it well I get giggly because for him is so easy like that just get rid of things take and then dispose off them
For me is very hard
Because it cost you a lot to find the house
I still not put curtains they are getting here slowly
None
We bought at JCPenny
None
They get here little by little first some curtains got here last night for the upstairs side
None
Then I got the other upstairs part and I still  am needing three curtains that need to get here
They are the living room curtains
The ones in the living room because I did not use blinds.
New York. I am in Georgia.
I only use blinds in the dining room because I have large windows.
None
Then they do not exist in that size unless you have one made exclusive for them.
Especially for
Hi,
Hi
Who's this?
My name is Annie
Hi Annie, I'm Arturo
Hi, Arturo.
Where are you calling from?
Miami
From Miami, I'm calling from
Where?
Philadelphia
Philadelphia
Exactly
Puerto Rican
Ok
And you?
I'm Mexican
None
Yes
Are you studying here in the United States?
Exactly
That's good.
Do you study or work?
I have a twenty-three month old daughter and a four day old son.
None
No, I'm working
Yes, of course
Not outside of home
Yes, a lot of work at home i imagine
Yes
That's good, but very happy, right?
Yes, a little tired, but very happy.
Yes, your son is four days
Four days
A little
Yes,
Why do you live in the United States?  Have you lived there your whole life?
Yes, my parents are from Dominican Republic
Okay
In the Nineteen seventy
None
I believe it was sixty-three.
None
But a revolution in Santo Domingo
OK
And they went to live to Puerto Rico
Okay.
They lived there for about twenty years.
None
When my sister went to college, she came here to the state of Florida. Then we moved to Miami.
OK
I think I was five years old
Ah, very small
Yes my sister is ten, eleven years older
None
Then from there we, we stayed and
Yes,
I went to school here and you know we made a life here
Yes, of course.
And
And now you are married with a Latino, or an American?
An American
I see.
Yes, I met him at University
K this from here, in Miami I suppose
No, I went to
Okay.
In
OK
Then I met him there
I see, very good,
Then
And
None
And what language do you speak with your, well it is that now you don't want to talk yet, your children true because
Well
He is twenty-four months.
She is twenty-three months and the other is four days old
Twenty three, yes. No, it is.
What we do here when he is not here, my husband is not at home
None
I speak completely in Spanish to my daughter
Okay
When he is here we speak English.
Okay
That way, she can learn both languages.
Recognize them
I get surprised because many times she says things
Yes we want my daughter to also practice a sport but we want to wait until she's a bit older because she's just five years old maybe she's much too young
I hadnt realised she had already learned
Oh, really
It is in English or Spanish.
Wow
She is already learning
Very fast
Yes,
I don't know at what age kids start talking normally.
And I think she was fifteen, sixteen months
Okay
She's learning English and Spanish.
None
You take the kids that take a little more time to talk.
Yes
So I picked up my little girl and her friends.
Yes,
She needs to speak louder
Yes,
Until recently
None
I knew she could understand and could speak
Yes, but
He had to learn the language that was a little more difficult
It is much more difficult.  But I believe it will be good in the long run.  But not very good so far.  The language is an advantage
Yes
The truth
But, you know it, I know that she understood
None
What I was saying
Yes, I imagine
I know she understands me because when she doesn't know how to do something, it makes her feel dumb.
Yes
I see her little face, and I know she understands me, exactly
Children are very clever.
Yes
None
So she understands it, she speaks it.
None
And
I hope she stays like that because that's when she's growing, and a lot of her friends speak English. She's going to practice English more I think
We are not going to send her to school but home-school her
Okay.
Because I was a teacher.
None
Then I think that, instead of going and teaching someone else's kids, I should stay home
Yeah
I can teach my own children.
Yes, that's true
So
But, what do you think about her not having school mates?
Well
That's also not an experience, bone
Yes, there are many programs here in Miami, for people who teach their children at home
None
Then, usually once a week, they will be together
Okay
Then it's like school, they have a class that they'll have to teach in English or at the University, but as a school that meets once a week
Okay
I have many friends and family who have done that.
The
I don't have any problems.
Okay
None
Yes,
I want her to have lots of friends
Yes, of course that's what I was thinking, that's part of the experience, no, to be in school with people you know
Yes
I think that it's important when you're a kid to have true friends.
Yes
I don't think so
Yes.
But yes as long as she has contact with other people for at least once a week only
They have sports.  In other words, the places in the community
Yes there are many, there's a lot of contribution from the community
They socialize
Yes, I see
You know
Yes since in Mexico that's not common you understand, it doesn't happen at all
Yes,
So I don't know anyone who has come out from that type of school, you understand. and I've always been very curious about how they do it here in the United States, because here I do know is much more common, there are a lot of people that
I dont know that he come from home schooling
Yes, it's like any other experience how you take it can be good or it can be bad.
Yes
But I also think how the schools are here, also how the kids are
It can be very bad also
Yes, I would like for her to have friends and all those things, but at the same time I think I have to protect her.
Yes, but you have to be careful. Then again it's bad to over-protect them.
Yes
It can be very bad
I want to teach her for a reason and a way to present her.
Yes.
You know
Yes.
It's different than what they show you in school.
Until what grade do you think to home school her?
I don't know. I haven't given it much thought since she's only two years old.
Yes
And I haven't started
In time we'll see
Yes
Are you planning to teach him the whole elementary grades?
At least sixth grade
Okay
We'll see because I can teach her up to High School
Yes
None
You've taught classes up to high school?
Yes
Which subjects?
Well, I was an special education teacher
Yeah
I taught everything.
OK I see.
If you don't agree I won't do it.
Yep.
If I don't understand the topic I teach it to myself and then I am able to teach it to the kids.
OK I see.
How are we going to say algebra
No
I don't know but could forget it.
If
Because I don't have time
Yep
Before I started the class I remembered everything.
No
What's there to do?
Yes, of course
I could teach them
None
That isnt so hard that i know for someone else it could be not for me.
Yes, in high school, the subjects get more specialized, like chemistry and physics is more advanced.
I know that now
None
They have classes for kids that can take and solve them on the computer
Yes
And they can go to high school on the internet
Yes
There are many options
Yes
That one must
Yes, no
To register the (person!?) in a public school
None
I know that these Universities
None
Have classes for kids too, in high schools that can be taken in the University
Yes, I heard about that
We have many options
Very good luck
And
He is barely two years old and right now there is no need to think a lot about this.
No, but since my husband says that I'm a teacher
None
I'm always reading her books, I'm singing her songs
None
So that she is having fun but learning something at the same time
Yes.
So I'm not really giving her formal schooling
Okay
But I am teaching her
None
Little by little, she already knows the alphabet. Well she knows the song
Yes, she reads
Yes, so she already knows the numbers
Yes,
A little.  If I tell her one she can tell me two, three.  Then the next one she tells me.  She already known that eight comes after seven.  Things like that.
Yes, she already knows the order
Little by little
Yes, That's good.
So you know
Yes, sounds very interesting.
Yes
If I was in your situation, I do not know how I would do it.
I can't give my son classes because I didn't have an education to be able to give classes.
None
I imagine you must have studied something like Education
Well
What did you study?
I studied education but they didn't teach me how to teach a kids
Yes, no
All those things I had to learn when I was working
None
So I'm using the experience
All that you acquired when the schools gave classes
Yes, But for that reason for me to do it with my son
None
It's not a problem because I already have the experience.
My name is Mariza.
Good afternoon, my name is Lorena. I am here in San Antonio, Texas
Hello
Hello, today's topic is very moving.
Yes, it's hard to me to think about which one is better.
I said it is going to be memories. Memories are the most important thing that can happen in life. You live off memories.
Exactly. The more time goes by, more memories there are, I wouldn't know which one to choose to start with
None
The best
That's how it is, I am a mom
Yes, me too.
I would like to think about the best that has happened to me, maybe it is to have had my children, I remember that at the moment in which I was having him I said, this is the best that has happened my whole life then I want
Of course
I want to be consistent with this comment that I made to myself at the moment that something was happening, but however there must be also other things
Wonderful and maybe you cannot select just one really
Of course, that is what I was thinking and also I asked that if that had not happened how your life would have been different. In your case, not having had your children
Yes, I wouldn't have liked it.
It is
Now they are bigger. They have given me so many beautiful things, that made by myself it wouldn't have been enough to get so many memories and so many
I have a son who has some health problems and that is very painful
Yes
Emotions are more tender and higher one one end, and then we have the husband
Yes, and it's that. No. Yes. Yes. But the children.
That also has a lot to do
Yes
None
No
But yes, I would think that it can't be just one just one event
Sure,
A painful event,painful memory, the death of my mother for example
The death of a family member has to be the worst that can happen to someone.
Yes or a son's illness also
Also
It's very painful.  You can't say that's only you.  But it's nice to try to think about it, no
Sure like the second part of my question, it was that what would have been of your life if that had not happened, that negative or painful event
Yes
I mean that the person wouldn't be there alive. As in my case, my mom is still alive but my grandparents both died a long time ago.
And I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because I lived far away, so that maybe the would be that that what would have been of the my life would have been different, if not because of course they couldn't meet my husband, or my daughter either.
Then yes
Exactly
Life would be pretty different
Where did you meet your husband?
Here in the United States
Because you are from Spain
Yes, I'm from Spain.
Yes
I came here to study but I met him, ended up staying and I've been here for twelve years
None
I have a five year old girl. My life has changed because kids change parents' lives. She is still very young and I still have some time
Yes, yes sure.
And so, nothing, I know, It's different when kids are older, they become more independent but I still have to go through that
There are so many things and so many phases.
Sure
But at this age is when kids are more loving
Yes, everybody says that
It's a very loving phase and when they grow up they go out and do their own things and, for example, that's nice too but you don't get that much love as you used to
Mom, I had a good time. This is more like a conversation, a different level
They don't depend on you that much; they are not that close.
Yes
But it's really nice, it really is, so, to you, what is the best thing that has happened to you, your best memory
I only have one child. I don't know if I'll have more.
Okay
I don't believe I was ready to be a mother because it was a big change and pregnancy was really hard and the
We have raised her, my husband and I, here both alone. Then it was a little bit difficult, but also to have a kid change your life is the best thing to have happened to me
Until now
Yes
It can be compared with anything.
It is twenty five or twenty four
Of course
None
The other question was what could be different if I had not lived and maybe not have been a mother. My life would be very different
I finished the studies.
Right exactly
Of course, got a more more important career, or had travel more or met some other person, but of course you never know you only can imagine.
Exactly, and however you go accumulating
Yes
Memories in Christmas, high school festivals and kid sports festivals pictures.
None
It is like precisely, putting together this life because it is like it was made of memories, not
Exactly yes, I have thousands and thousands of pictures, all are of my daughter, that's because, the
It's easy to say what is most important, because excluding that of course, without that i don't know.  I traveled a lot, I've met interesting people that you can't compare with
With the children, I guess
Like a whole and you don't study to become mother
No
The human being doesn't study how to love but finally the emotion is more profound and complete, no
Yes, like I was telling to my sister that she doesn't have any children now but when she will become a mother she will come to know how it feels to be a woman.
Complete because they've been married 20 years.  No, they don't have any children and I don't think they will.  It's difficult to explain.
It's difficult to explain.
It's difficult to explain.
The expedition and those huge cars and that spend like that? it can only run like around twenty miles, eighteen miles per gallon, that is a huge expense
Yes a had him because i say i already had thirty years, and i said it was time to have one, have one now or don't bother if we get to old because
To raise a child you should be patience and energetic.
Lots of energy, indeed.
Of all.  Yes, my daughter requires a lot of patience and sacrifice
None
And
Yes, actually because she's very playful
She is hyperactive not like me when i was a child because i was lot more quiet and did all my father said
She is more like three, sometimes is
Yes
I finish tired after all those days.
That's how it is.
And
They have a strong and active character,.
Yes that is what i think of waiting for her
I believe she will achieve many things
Yes, if i compare her to my niece, they are so different, I think that my daughter, she has a much stronger character perhaps that will help her in the future to get ahead
With all the difficult things that will comfort her, the challenges
Clearly
No, I have a daughter, the youngest is like that and on top of being really good in her studies she is also an excellent sportsperson
Yes, exactly.  That is what we want, for my daughter to practice a sport.  But we want to wait until she's a bit older.  She's just five years old.  She's much too young, but
She has the body to become a sportsperson and perhaps that will help her develop more and
Perhaps her character could too
Yes
None
And perhaps calm her
She can get tired
Yes, we can't continue likes this
Yes, she needs to get tired, what ridiculousness
I don't know; they tell me that it's the age.
Where do you live?
We're living in Philadelphia right now.
My eldest daughter is studying at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
What a coincidence, it is a good university
Yes, it is in Philadelphia
Yes, here is a city where many young and important people come to study
Yeah
We have found movies that are for children
I would like my daughter to go to the university, but we are years away from that.
What did you study?
Psychology, but I did not finish the degree.
None
Well after I was pregnant we wanted to raise her at home e did not want to take her to a day care because we felt that it's the traditional form that I was raised, that I was with my parents, they took care of me
None.
We did not want to leave her alone in a daycare, alone
That is a good decision
Yes it is good.
I have to take a lot of vitamins to have the necessary energy .
Yes, while it is possible
Now you will see how quickly time passes I, celebrated my youngest daughter's fifteenth birthday yesterday
Wow
When you look back you will have many more memories of what she did, and that will be yours because
They achieve great things thanks to the support that parents can give, and from what is given, what you are giving, not like you are saying that you leave to one side
Maybe your career or your profession are more personal
Yes
None
Hi my name is Juan
Oh, it's a pleasure, Juan
Pleasure is all mine. Where are you?
None
Where are you?
I'm here in the state of Idaho
Yeah
Where are you speaking from?
I'm in Texas, in San Antonio
Wow, a little far away.
Of course
We got the subject of movies.
Yes
I don't understand a lot about the ratings. I know that there are movies that are PG thirteen, PG
Yeah
I've seen some that have more swear words that are PG.  They're more violent and more
None
Yes.
I don't understand
I haven't taken into consideration those classifications
OK
I can't understand them very well
OK
I think they are, a little bit complicated, instead, they should have a little bit more information about what they have.
Yes, I would have loved to learned how to play an instrument, but I'm horrible at that stuff.
Ok, but in general, as i no longer have little children
Yes
Children, i don't worry too much
Yes
About those classifications; however, I worry because when we go to see a movie that's worthy, that's interesting, and not just any movie, then the classification...
Yes
I am so interested in that as much as i am in the quality and the comments i hear about the movies
Right
I dont know if you do the same if you always go with someone
No, I'm married, I've been married for three years and I do have a kid, he's 20 months old
Right.
Just about to turn two years old and  I am concerned about that
For example, he, if we watch a movie and we really love it, we love it if it's ~PG or ~PG 13
Right
What we watch the most, we don't really like, neither him nor myself, to watch adult movies, or those that
None
Up to PG13
Yes
Those, or at times one that is R, but the truth is that I don't pay attention. For example if there is a movie that we like
Yes
We buy it and, for example, sometimes it has nude scenes or something like that; my husband grabs the movie and erases that part.
None
We do it mostly because there are times when neither my husband nor me are going to be there, so then the children might grab the movie and could watch it.
My husband will record a commercial.
None
They can watch the movie,it will be purely cars or action.
Yes
If you take away the part that is a bit pornographic, because you see that always, even though it's a good movie it always has to have some nudity.
Yes
At times it has nothing to do with it
There is always something.
We have movies that are action or cars, and suddenly up comes something that has nothing to do with that
It has nothing to do with it
That's what we have done because we are going to have other children. Once in a while they will be alone and we don't have to worry that they are going to watch a movie, then
There will be no problem
Yes, yes, I believe that in that sense, you might be right
Yes,
Ook that very curiously
Yeah,
What worries me the most in the movies is language and the violence
Yes, because it really
Generally because when there is an exaggeration in language
Yes,
Or in violence, everything else is the same
Yes
So when the movie is like that, R, obviously it will have scenes of all types.
Yes
The movie rating R means that it has restricted content, but it may be an exaggeration.
Yes, right.
Showing the ones that supposedly are PG-13, that is for children of thirteen years of age that can see it then, but sometimes, they say vocabulary and sometimes they show scenes that
Of nudity and that, so then, since they will be watching,
Yes,
I am Mexican
None
For example, on television they care of you and on movies they still care of you a bit
Look at that.
I don't know. It makes me
Making memory of the movies we have gone to see lately, they are all
Very fast
PG thirteen I don't know where to hold it because the ones we have around here
None
Available at the theaters
None
They are, simply not really good
Yes
Then no, let's not worry much abouth that information because my kids are already teenagers we always go to the theater all together
None
We always go for the quality of the movie more than anything else.
Yes
The classification they have to oriented us about the movies does not give us much information
Sometimes it does not say anything, because sometimes for example is says
We don't take it into consideration.
When you are watching it, bang it's different to what it told you
None
If it says It has too much violence, and is not violent, it is not clear information.
Sometimes
None
You don't even pay attention to it.
None
Those things that they sell, for example, to sell TV sets
What
That they remove or block bad words and stuff like that, those work sometimes but they don't all the time, they work but I don't really own one
One of my friends says they don't work properly because they sometimes block words that are not bad, and real cuss words are not blocked.
Yes
None
I think we should be involved in the education of our children
None
We've never done any acts
Yes
We talked
Yes
When we are worried about this, we say hey, that was really unnecessary, they could've cut it out of the film, that was rude
Yes
No, we analyze it as a way to educate our kids.
Yes
It generally works for us, they are older now
Yes
And now, he has good common sense about which movies to watch and which ones
I remember when my mom would watch a movie with me and we would always watch movies after ten in the evening.
We knew that we were always going to find
None
My mom would take a chance to get ugly movies.
None
The ones that are not made for children, but for example, she would say if they were airing a movie that had bad language
Yes
Or something different than nudity, but still, like with little clothes on or when we were kids,
None
You can watch it and then you will understand more and she would say
Yes
When you say, Turn around and look away, you are not supposed to see that, it's like you are telling them to do so.  The teenages will do it because they are wondering why their mom told them not to watch.
Sure
If the movie is playing on the television, they are wondering why they can't watch it.
They are going to find out about those things in the end, they are going to have opportunities to see all those things
Negative/positive
Talking about those things should be censured.
Yes
That type of thing I have never thought of. It has good because
Yes, I believe that
There is too much information about movies that it would be convenient to go see with your family.
Yes
Inform ourselves what the movie is about and the quality which is made
Yes, this is true
Because there is too much violence in cartoons
Yea,
There are cartoons that are made for children and has exaggerated violence
Yes, and shown during the day?
Everyone in the White house is a reightwing republican.
Yes
No, and the others are okay, less than five percent are worth watching.
Yes
No, but with those you have enough to have an idea of what you must be looking for
Yes
There are so many movies made, you don't have to see them all.
That's true.
Right, and then
That's true
Yeah, now in fact I am working with the deaf children's parents.
Right
About the critics towards that movie and then we go.
Yes
That's what we look for when we go to see this movie
Right
Since my kids were little, they've had that education because he likes the movies
Right
Never even when they were little
Right
If there was a movie sometimes we took them even if it was fro the older people
Right
And yes, maybe some scenes could be a little stronger, but one scene doesn't necessarily make the movie.
Right
So we tried to talk about the message, right?, for example, a lot of war movies, right?
Yes
A lot of war movies are, for example, saving private
Yes, good evening.
Good evening I am Joe
What is your name?
Joe
Joe?
What is your name?
Alex.
Alex, where are you from?
I am here in Los Angeles I think we've spoken before about religion.
Yes, I remember.
We talked on the fourth of October,
What a memory.
Where are you from again?
I am from Denver, Colorado.
Yes.
What do you think about tonight's topic?
I watch television by quality not by classifications.
Yes, me too, I don't pay much attention to the classification, apart from and I am at an adult stage no of course I have a little girl that
I monitor her television activity so she doesn't get scared.
Of permissive things also in the for example, the movies out there, I now think that it's more violent. I don't know if
Enough to classify because they are making very violent movies with lots of topics
Yes, no, I am interested in movies and television through the topics they have
Yes
Good movies teaches us something
A documentary has value.
Sure
One cannot deny the truth of life
Sure
You can not live life with blinded eyes.
Like the movie that is, the allies, about the Iraq war that I believe is about the experience the soldiers are having
This one with the colored actor, his name is Jamie, I think it is Jamie Foxx
Yes
There's another boy that is traumatized when he is experimenting in Iraq. Those things are very real and they happen every day there.
Those movies may be political critique
Yes, true
The Bush administration, maybe it has always been obsessed with war.
Yes
MIsstrusting the iraq public.
Yes, transfering many things from outside of the lie he told in order to invade Iraq
It is not worthy to do that, more than one thousand soldiers already died
Those movies are very important because the majority of people are very ignorant about things that happen in life
Because you don't have information
It's true
The information we get is propaganda. It is important to see other versions of what happens in the world, not only the Bush administration's version.
Yes, it's true. i think that movie classification today is rather relative. I know they have from thirteen,
These days is beyond what is permitted or not
Many movies don't make sense, especially gang movies.
None
They need to see the violence
Those movies are bad
Yes, very bad
Because they show the violence
It glorifies it.
Yes, and they only do it to sell it, not for the value
And that isn't for selling to
Certain people.
Yes, that's why i see you boys copying that in the way they dress or walk and even talk because those are their heroes
Those shows and movies corrupt the young and show them fake values.
Society, the parents, the family has a lot to do to make them understand those things and how to treat them
I see something that I don't want her to see.  I don't force her in such a manner, saying don't watch that
I try to teach her why this program is not good for her
Me too I have a fourteen year old son
None
I have to set control on sex channels whenever he visit me.
Yes
Yes, he's obsessed with that show and watches it while I work
None
So I have had to control him, he can't do it anymore because I already have it controlled, but I have it controlled because it took the step to control it.
Yes,
It is the job of each mom and dad to controlthe television that their kids are gong to watch and not blame the classifications.
Yes, in my house, I have basic cable so there's no channel that crosses the line
Do you have teenagers?
No, my daughter is only five years old
Yes, a girl.
There's a Disney channel that she loves to watch and also we watch the discovery channel which she likes, and there's another other
Comedy program that are not that bad that we both watch together, she likes to laugh a lot, she likes funny things
But when there are things that go beyond, that cross the line, I don't let her watch because I don't want her to learn those things.
They make those things interesting, even when it's not morally or socially correct.
Yes,  you can teach your kids but, the truth is that you as a parent should not have your eyes closed,
They are going to have more temptations than what we had.
Yes
No, we are not good fathers according to culture.
Which culture is more
Today's teenage culture involves gangs, hip hop music, a lot of sex and violence.
The videos
The videos
All of these things.
It is not easy to control everything that you try and I try to explain the consequences if you do this
Yes I'd like to understand what happens and what are the consequences if he has sex with a girl.
Yes
One has that to continuously talk to them about the things that the parents see because I am a substitute teacher in school.
Yes
They care a lot about the boys when they are five - ten years old. When they need help, the parents are not there.
We begin to fail
The teenage years are critical
Its the teenage years where they start to do more.
Exactly
Not only when he is five or six years old
The manner and reason to think they say we were teenagers, i remember how i was in those years
I had my rebellious spirit but it's when parental guidance is most necessary.
All depends on the education from the fathers
The classification is just a number
And if anyone comes to see, it's like when they're all alone with their friends. They can see whatever they want because there is nobody to forbid them to do it
Yes.
If anybody helps him by talking about what is good and what is wrong, that helps a lot
To make a wrong choice
We must give the boys a basis. What's good and what's wrong. Not only when they are five or six years old, but when they're fifteen, sixteen, eighteen years old
Exactly
And it is more important when they're fifteen than when they're five, because when they're five they're going to follow the easy rules
Yes.
When they're fourteen or fifteen, that's another story.
They believe themselves more independents, that they don't need their parents anymore
They already have friends and fit in
Yes.
Mom and dad are busy, but they still have to work
Young people influence nowadays is pretty big. I agree, but I remember I also was influenced by my friends when i was younger.
But I can see that technologies and such things are greater. Because really the movies, back in time when I was a boy weren't as violent as they are now
There weren't video games either and television was more restricted. Neither all that modern violence, nor blood or bodies were shown like the CSI and all those shows are pretty graphic, classics.
Show things if they were real
None
Well, young people get used to watch that as acceptable but when I was growing up if those things were shown it would have been chaos!
It wouldnt have been allowed at all, but times are changing and thats why young people are influenced by it.
In a big and negative way, these things are acceptable in our society. I
Yes.
I hope that when my girl becomes a teenager that I'm
Now, that's going to be in a very little time, my friend
Yes, I know, time flies.
Time flies.
I remember when she used to be a little baby, now she's jumping, running everywhere, learning lots of new things, being curious, asking a lot of questions.
Hello, my name is my name is Marisa from Philadelphia
Hello, Marisa?  This is Carolina from Los Angeles.
Good evening.
Here it is good afternoon
T is three hours earlier, yes
My mother, how is it going to be? Today we have a very difficult topic
Very difficult
Ay, my dear mother, because I am from Venezuela.
None
Where you from?
I am a Spaniard.
None
Well
We are living in a very critical moment with the United States and our new president.
Yes.
My dear mom
Yes, I experience something similar, but my beliefs about the United States aren't great either.
Wow,
Of the United States which is what
It is strong
It's very
Even, I don't know if you have this, knowledge of a page that's called TV For All
There you can see the television channels of
No.
All the countries of the world, including Spain.
Yes.
It's called that
TV for all
All television for everyone
None
There you can see, and we randomly, we have been looking, a particular channel from Venezuela
None
And, well, English, in fact a
None
Especially with our president, who is a person.
As we say in Venezuela, clear and rough
None
I don't know if you had the opportunity to hear him
Well I think so.
Exactly. Then
Yes, in Philadelphia, you have various Hispanic channels like Telemundo, Univision
None
Galavision and all that.
Smae as here
And you hear it all, yes
You know that all those people air whatever they want
Here we have Government control
Exactly, exactly
We only hear what they want us to hear.
Correctly, and they put, including this, sometimes they twist
None
They twist what is happening and then i always meet people that, for example, say damn, you, what do you have to say about that crazy guy you have as president ?
They touch me and that is why i totally agree with that crazy guy
Was that after they tell all those atrocities to you?
None
I try to have patience, because it's a delicate issue.
Yes
I did not have any incovenience with some Venezuela people
None
People that have lots of years here and lack the knowledge about what really happens there
Yes
They are afraid of the idea that they have been slfd, communism, that I don't know what Fidel
I really don't have as much knowledge as you have but the situation that we are living in Venezuela is a very special situation
None
Very distinct to Venezuela, that is that it doesn't have anything to do with the Cuban reality, with what happened in Cuba, how I know, I know they
They assumed it was that system, so I adopted the necessary system for them.
They were applying that because there were mistakes in everything, just like the mistakes we have right now.
None
We have been making mistakes, however, well it is being work on function of that, like the president says clearly he has a claim against
Government, not against the the country but against the government
Of course.
Well they assume some politics how would you say it best, arbitrarily
The world's police are the ones that pretend to be
Exactly
Bosses of everything and, and they tell you what is going to happen, and if you do not agree, well in a bad way you have to agree with them
Exactly. Correct, that is, and if not, then, I extort you you,
It is exact.
None
With embargo with everything there might be, or the worst ways, with violence, with war
Exactly.  So it is a situation rather
This
Delicate, but I believe, the North American town is waking up in some way
None
And there are a bit more people that are realizing what is really happening, because they have them like in a bubble
Still a lot is lacking, and that is what gives me more
Yes
It makes me mad to see how other people manipulating the people.
Clearly
And you intend to tell the other person, but look its like this. You don't realize? So they tell you no, because you are
Liberal, or communist, or you
Clearly
They give you these labels
Some labels continue, bad ones, in passing
You are not a terrorist and we don't want you.
Correct
And I say, but yes, no this country, not bad they are not country, it is he the leaders of the country
Exactly, that is what they sometimes say to me. What are you doing here?
Yes
I said to him, look I could be in Venezuela and not support the president or the fact that you are in a
Country or not, or you fled your country does not imply that you have a position
None
The people are here.
Of course.
In the opportune moment, but that has nothing to do with the opposition because of how many people. For example, they don't live in Venezuela and what they are doing is throwing them the enema
To the Venezuelan government and the town
None
You don't have to be here or there to support or not supportit is a position. when they tell me that, it makes me laugh.
Yes.
Because. what do they do here? and well it may be the same thing you are doing thank God. That you are here and not in Venezuela.
N Spain it is the same what happens is that left government even if it were right it is another mentality
I have never seen that they make manifestations and left here that is never seen
Correct, no. Well with all the gasoline problems that have really been, well look
None
In a surprising manner, that the people can not, no, they don't protest, I say, my God but what happens with these people?
I dont know what happens or they change their car and they buy a more economic car
Yes.
They don't have that necessity to protest
Yes.
I don't know if you were in Pennsylvania?
Yes, Philadelphia
I feel like people are starting to wake up.
None
I feel that they are rejecting the politics of the current president and that really things are not like they are painting them because
In the beginning I did not have access to that. Could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela? I would speak with my friends
The power of television is
Yes
Speaking precisely about the topic
Power, yes
Television is huge power
Yes, they are the ones that control.
None
Philadelphia is a liberal city.  Everyone is a Democrat, but the rest of the state is Republican.  People that have things told to them
Very radical
Correct.
That are very religious, very closed off, then
Yes
It is not going to change
What are you doing over there in Philadelphia?
We lived here a year ago before we moved to Florida.
Okay.
I'm looking for a job.  We have just moved and
And do you think it's better there than Miami?
The work in the south is really saturated, I like it better here in the north
Ok.
Easier
Right and you came here and what did you do?
He is working in pharmaceutical industry doing clinical research
Okay
I do administrative work and I volunteer.
Ok, and whatever goes, right.
Whatever I can find.
All the same I was like flying because they said, this is my first boyfriend and and probably I'm going to get married with him and things like that,
Twelve years.
Twelve?
None
Dear mother. I have been here six years, and we're about to come back if God permits.
Where are you from?
It is good to move like that.
Then the republicans came in with Bush, and everything went to hell, like they say.
Yes sir.
It is todiendo, little by little. And don't know the world Spain is already.
Yes
When I go to Spain, my husband, that is American tells me he has resentment. He says look at your country
The world is destroyed. It is taking over everything, and
None
They believe that they are the owners of everything
Yes
And there is power resentment
Yes notice that before I used to be a little like that.and and today I understand that is not like that is like us because we do not have
Fault of the government.
Sure
Before I used to see the Americans like gringos, well I now understand that they're americans/united states citizens because this is another concept that works? no?
Yeah
We are also Americans if it comes to that
Sure
And then after that I start to reflect a little and no they are not North Americans no so it is the government politics what they do
They decide, then we sure it reflects against the town against the country
None
That is the political state of the government.
Yes I don't like I'am Spanish and American I one here the need,and it seems like but me
Sure.
I have to deal with the government
Yes,being in the democracy you have your right to protest
You don't say anything
Yes, I don't, I hope that this,
It's like a dictatorship, yes.
The linguistic project depite fairly controversial issue doesn't effect anyone.
Very
The issue, so I said.
I
None
I'm going to talk about Bush, because I have so much anger, I have to talk about Bush and put it bad because
Thanks to God you're not alone.  I listen to many people that say it's not, they rant and rave about him and I say
Yes.
The people have realized.
None
They think that the people are so dumb that they're not going to realize.
None
The atrocities done by them.
No, and later, they throw their hands above their head and exclaim, oh my god, that can't be.
No, by next week they forget about it because...
Sure
The press and TV move onto something else to distract, then people forget
A short while ago the Latin American film festival ended
None
And btw, they showed a movie, The Argentinian, but the directors were Spanish.
None
And then because you know that the Spanish film industry has many types of movies, this one was a protest movie.
Yes
Documentary
Mhn.
My name is Ibet, With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
This is Mercedes.
How are you and where are you from Mercedes?
From Honduras.
Honduras?
None
I have a sister-in-law and she's from Honduras also.
Where exactly?
I don't know, but I know she's Honduran as well.
That's nice.
Yes.
Where are you from?
I'm from Mexico.
The city, the capital?
Rom the city. yes, Mexico City.
What do you think about today's issue?That is it easier to break up with someone when you're young
That difficult stage i passed and get married.
It's difficult when you actually love the person, when you don't love her it's like everything else. We break up.
Each to his own.
Yep.
I think when you really love someone it works out, but in this case, you didn't get along with them.
I really do not know.  Maybe they did not want to get between the two people, I believe there should be more than nothing
Communication in a relationship
None
Between the relationship there is not one of the two ieces starts to lloose th descon there is going to be distrust
I believe this can cause a break up but i know that i feel it does hurt
Did you ever have a break up that was hard?
Yes, before I married my husband I was going with a person
It was not a long time my first boyfriend
Yes?
Then this one
It's hard always.
It took me a small while with him it was not too the same but it was the first illusion I had, don't know and I had even said that no with him I will get married
I will have three children and I was putting my castles in the air and once he came and said not me until it was over.
How?
None
I believe there was I had more experience to say, until now everything is finished that I know to say then I believe for him
It's easy for me
None
After today yes. Everything was for the best because I met the one that is now my husband and he is a lot better.
The truth
How good
I don't know
You have only had two boyfriends
That's right, and
Just looking for troubles
And you?
When there is no need
Yes, how did it happen?
It's been long time since, I don't think I ever had a difficult experience.
None
With a boy. With the first boyfriend I had, we stayed for about two years
None
I remember we decided that then, I don't remember the exact reason, we would break up
None
That was ten years ago
Wow
I was nineteen, eighteen. It was
Are you married now?
Yes
None
And, afterwards we let ourselves be seen. Afterwards, that was not so difficult because we were apart. He lived on his own and I lived on my own.
None
Another boy with whom I used to move out, he didn't live with me now.
None
We were in university and he returned to his country of origin
None
That one was also easy because you stop seeing him
Yes.
None
Yes.
After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend.
In my case with the first person that I fell in love too much
It was a lot
None
He loved me. It wasn't long, two or three months.
None
I don't want to let it affect me.
Yes.
I think that he didn't think that way, I don't know if I was his third, fourth, fifth
So he said yes, well I'm not going to marry her, I'm going to be with her and get to know here and that's it. On the other hand, I think I was the one that was getting my hopes up because of that
To tell you the truth, it hurts
Really
Yes, it hurts because I think you are excited and have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no
I think it hurts a lot more when married couples are impacted by it.
Yes.
I think it must be the worst experience of your life.
None
I hope to never go through that. I've been married three years and everything is working wonderfully, everything is fine
Thank God.
A lot of communication and things like that.
You say that is nothing. Everything can be perfect is true always
Yes.
Because there are peopel that are mistaken, there's people that think that mariage is according to the stage. And everything is peaceful
No.
Ou live with the person day and night you see it
Yes
It's impossible for it to remain, right?
No, yes.
You always love the person but is impossible for there to always be only peace, that's what I'm saying
Yes.
Because I am one. It is to be human and one has to do things that bother other people a lot. And
Yes.
To any other people, I am not saying to the person in with that one is particularly, but any other person. I know that
Eventually, well like that, we have a saying, no it's a coin of the whole world, all day, the twenty-four hours of the day, for all the rest of the life,
It is.
Yes.
Yes, it has to be something of the truth. Very difficult to keep it so. Everything is happy but
None
I think that, when you take your engagement,  you go knowing the person
You're not going to know that thoroughly until you are married with that person
I have known people that they beat up their boyfriends
I think that those relationships well nothing is going to come from nothing good, because if they still aren't married
And to behave
They behave so imagine how it's going to be if they're going to be married. In a little bit they are going to say you are my owner
None
Now like they treat her then I think that those relationships, I think that they're not going to work ever, I don't know. Or, change him or
Change or end a relationship like that, I think that if it was a relationship like that it doesn't have to hurt anything
You have to think it over if you have a boyfriend that beats you.
None
You're going to rest and say that it's good we finished. I think that if everything starts doing it well and everything
Everything is going well.  Suddenly someone must travel to another country, or has to go to another school.  I think that would hurt a bit.
Yes.
Because, everything is fine, but only the third circumstances, they have to separate. I think that this type of relationships, that really hurts, but if it's a relationship that
That they hit you and things like that no
There are times when those relationships are most difficult one.
For people that are involved in that type of relationship
That's true.
People when they are in that type of situation there is very low self confidence
None
People think that what I'll be able to achieve is better.
I have to endure. I have to keep on enduring.
Yes.
Really it's not as easy as one thinks, he did that to me, I'm going to send him packing
That's true.
Let's not say an addict. Yes to that type of situation that
The drama is very, true? Then people don't know how to get out of that cycle of abuse, true? that's what happens.
That's right, yes, it's true because
Yes
For example one time while in Mexico I met a girl that one time she came by with dark glasses to work
None
And I told her, and now you wear glasses? Was it a cloudy day, right? And she had a bruise that her boyfriend had made
None
I told her that I think she shouldn't let her boyfriend touch her.
It is very difficult to end my relationship with him.
I still love him
Mhn.
I told her How can you love a person who beats you? Sometimes she used to come bruised
None
Used to smack her and similar things
No.
Those types of relationships are the hardest. When she managed to do it she used to cry.
Every time that she could, at every break and similar occasions because she missed him and all that. Therefore I think that yes,somehow sometimes
I imagine that it was very painful for her.
Carolina
Fabiola
What's up, Fabiola? How are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine.  What do you think about today's subject?
In Washington.
Dear mother, very far away.
And you?
I'm in Los Angeles.
None
Yeah
Extremes
We're just on opposite sides. That's good. Where are you from?
Chilean
From where?
Chilean, from Chile.
Oh, Chilean. Ok, I'm from Venezuela.
From Maracaibo?
Do you know people from there?
Yeah, I'm right here
Yeah. Well, you know that they have a stronger accent. Right? like, look and you.
Yes
Yeah,
Look and you, are you arepa?
Yes.  That's great.  Sometimes it's very difficult to find Venezuelans.  They say no.  We know very few Venezuelans.
We are very few here I think it has increased.
Yes.
None
I know, yes, I young woman from Venezuela, in Houston.
Do you work at the Hilton?
No.  In Houston, in
I heard in Hilton.
I work at home.
Okay. perfect.
Do you work?
Yes, I work with deaf children.
None
Yeah, when I got here, Bill Clinton was there. The country was in an incredible period; a lot of work, everybody was happy, the economy was going up
What a great job.
Listen, yes. Very strong work.
Yes, but it satisfies you having it
Yes
Having power to help people
Exactly, and i was doing the same in Venezuela, only that i was using the sign language.
I learned the alphabet there.
Chilean?
I learned, yes.
None
With signs
Correct. But, here is oral.
My daughter taught me the alphabet  and some words
Okay
Not all of them. Some like I love you and other
None
Yes, small words
Okay.
But, pretty
Yes, now I'm with the first oral part. No? I'm at the other end
Of the profession. Because here, the children are given incentives to talk.
How? To talk?
None
Without listening but talking
Yes, with auxiliary earpieces, they are able to listen in.
None
They train aurally so they can recognize the sounds.
How beautiful.
Yes. That is a possibility to be able to speak clearly. They will never be able to speak perfectly will feel the difference as her speak.
They will definitely have that opinion. That there are some parents who combine sign language with oral language. No? Depending on,
Depending on the grade of the auditory loss of a child. If it is very profound, wherein there are no possibilities even with the best operation
We utilize sign language as a complement.
What a hard job for parents.
It is great, hard work and very rewarding, and in the end you will have your reward.
In another form they are going to achieve it
What is your opinion on the topic that they gave us today?
It is a candle topic. I think that relationships between partners are not simple. You have to fight with a person that
That is different, that comes from another culture.
Sometimes it's a bit difficult, but I think that live is the only thing that makes it possible for barriers to be overcome more than anything.
Only if there's love and a lot of disposition from the partners so that those differences and those tiffs that can be had at any moment
They overcome themselves. you think so?
Yes, of course.  I think of love.  Because, love is like
None
It is acquired with time.
Of course.
With enthusiasm. I believe that you want to maintain your family. You have to want to keep a family because there are very few people who love
None
We have had two critical moments to the point of nearly separating. There was a point when maturity plays an important role.
Correct.
They don't work hard and they love each other more than a couple who has been married for 30 years.
Of course.
They struggle day to day and they overcome their problems.
Correct.
That's the first thing that occurs to them, fight, split up.
Yes.
To think that if they decided to stay or marry that partner,
Nonw
Well, it is forever already. Though there are problems, not to go running after the first problem that you found.
Of course. Well, see that I with my husband, we ave, we are going to reach eight years of marriage,
And, it went well. Furthermore, I was ready, I was ripe for the picking, as we say here. I said, Stop, I've got this fair
They gave me and potentialized it and it didnt sit well on him and he had  to stop using it and return to the basics.
Yes.
In another moment in my life I'd have done it.
Me too.
None
I had done nothing important.
I hadn't done nothing important either. look I don't see a damn thing.
Yes, as I said, stop me if I fall. What is the problem?
Exactly.
But now I think three things.
I understand. He has other things. I'm focused on the good things that he has. He is different from me, he can't think like [me] and it doesn't bother me.
But he gave me his ph-
I feel the same as well.
I understood exactly.  But unfortunately the first was horrible.  I thought that it was the end of the world.  I waited a long time that one day. We tried while I thought it was a good day.  But is that what's happening?
We were married three weeks. We had gone almost three weeks. Never in life had we lasted three weeks without seeing each other and sleeping in the same bed.
None
I said, do you understand this?
I haven't touched it. It hasn't come to that.
Hey, it's not that bad, it's very rude on our part, in reality. He said you know what? To me I think that this is full of crap.
It does not have to make sense. If you want to continue with the project, we will continue it. If you do not want to continue, we won't continue it. I love you,
I love you, but this can't continue, because you go for a day and I go for the other.
Is this what I need to define it this way? It's insensitive on our part, to live this way. Besides, in this way I don't believe in God. So what.
We will working on it. irrespective of how serious may be the situation, that luckily wasn't so serious but that neither side wanted give in
It was pride
Fool pride
Yes it is up to nothing
To nothing. But the opposite
It only affect
Exactly, then, well, fortunately we are back on track. And then after, we had another, however, this was smaller. I think the first one was the one which really left us marked
It;s the channel of the state but not as good as before
Ripe for the picking is like ready to throw in the towel
Ready to throw in the towel but not allowing to do so
If something I learned from this life is to search for solutions to problems that can be solved
Sure
What are we going to do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you yourself say, there are people who spend thirty years together and that's a crap relationship
Yes?
That treat each other bad. What [is this]? Why would I want it?
Sometimes they treat each other well but they don't love each other.
Exactly
They spend all their lives together
Yes. Look, Is that a thousand things happens, really. Couples go through so much that is, is an interesting topic.
There are people who like each other a lot, but don't love each other. I got accustomed to living with him
They respect
Exactly.
What they wanted to form was a family
There are others that don't. There are others that definitely they do whatever they feel like and they keep up an image.
There are others that say If there's no love, there's nothing.
Nothing but truth is more important in love, because i felt that in my relationship.
With a situation that was so difficult if there hadn't have been love,we would have broken up. it just wouldn't have made any sense.
It doesn't make any sense to continue something that where's there no love. Well, I feel that yes. A lot of love, and many of his promises that you were talking about, to actually love.
To be here because you want to be, because it was worth it.
Because nobody is forcing you. You want to be here and fight. And in order to maintain yourself,
Exactly.
You could have a couple, it's difficult. And when you have it, you have
Exactly.
The hardest, after, is to keep it going.
It is hard to keep things fresh and not fall into a routine.
None
No. As time goes by, the important thing is that you can not leave her.
Exactly, sure. I recognize that.
The system will also bring you to that conclusion.
Your husband is also Chilean?
No, he is from here.
Love can do anything.
So easy.
You think it is easier?
There is a mister from American music that we call it that is very good
Because, my husband is Venezuelan
For certain
I believe that has nothing to do with nationality. I believe that those are universal things.
Yes, I believe that for me it is easier because sometimes, the are very entertaining because I don't understand everything he says or he says it fast, then it doesn't go well, no, fighting had no point
A lot with him, because it makes me laugh.
What was that you said?
None
Bad.
Hello.

Not it hasn't been that long, it's been a short time
From Santiago probably.
Yes, from Santiago.

Hello

Well
This week, I've been kinda lazy.
Right, yeah, well, sure
Yeah
I'm telling you
Yes
Fun, they give you a subject to
To have something to talk about, i think
It must be
Yes
I thought this study was to make a phone menu and stuff like that
None
People wanted to talk anout things about health and stuff
No,  I was told that you have to talk about personal things.
Because you should not or because you do not want to do?
Because you should not, like personal things
None
But you never know if another person is on the phone
Of course, OK
So, that's why they give you subjects to have to talk about
It was part of the study that they wanted to hear words in Castilian and Spanish
Okay
No but no
All they told me was that I had to talk about issues of importance
None
Have a theme, don't talk as a head of sin
Is the fruit
None.
Yes
Yes, you like it here
No, of course Idaho is good.
None
Yes, I was in Washington near Seattle when I came to the United States.
None
And now I'm in Georgia, I'm in the south, so it's as good here as it is for everyone there, and I'm in Atlanta
Even more to be posted on there
None
But Idaho, for example is really rural, whereas here it isn't
Everything is really just the countryside
Yes, I would imagine myself there
There isn't much nightlife there
I bet. Atlanta is a pretty big city. Supposedly life should be really great here.
In two or three years
None
All the stores, and bars, and the clubs need to close at 2AM
Wow, at 2.
At 2 in the morning, everything is closed.
Why?
The reason is, that it has the sector and in Atlanta it's called Bucks Head
None
Two or three years ago there were some crimes and three people were killed.
None
Around there, then the city on top of the major what I do know, then the people are killing the
None
Yes a city like that has to be obligation.
Yes. But over there do people use cars?
Too many cars, yes
The same because to go out at two am is not that
Well it is that
If you have a car
I would prefer to have a good system for the problem.
Expensive
Yes
A lot of congestoin.
Okay.
None
Yes
Yes, the car
Here is totally different.
Yes, like over there
There are so many cars. People have cars because it is a necessity.
Yes
Because there is no bus. But,
None
Are, don't take to long to go to many places where I live. It's like half of Santiago's port. There are less people because
Yes
Since the houses are much bigger, they are further apart.
Of course, they are in
No, I am in Idaho Falls
Yeah
In Idaho Falls
Yeah,
I am going to a big city.
None
There in a much larger city, but
Of course
Where we are, no. It's country.
How great, is the same. gave a thing over there like this one. the one that The Washington University
None
We were latinos
No, here are a lot of machines.
Ready
A lot of Mexicans and it is more a rural place
None
They hire a lot of Mexicans to work in
None
The land and things like that
Sure
Almost all people you see are Mexican. Also, if the people see you they think you are Mexican.
Sure, yes.
At least latinos, they say Mexican
The weat
Then you are telling, no
No
I am not Mexican.
Sure, what I like a lot is when they believe I am Palestinian or Asian, if i go to some restaurants
Yes
Yes, from the middle east
None
They try to talk to me in Arabic, I don't know. They think I have more of an Indian face or something, of course, and is there discrimination over there?
Yes, the same, but not the same
None
Everywhere else
Sure
The same, is that more than anything it is with people that are Latin but don't know much speak but
Sure.
People just follow the crowd
Sure.
And then they have to walk
Yes. Yes. Sure
Over there they are very discriminating
Over here is super Atlanta and all of the South is sixty percent black.
Okay
The fact that it is more diverse is much more acceptable, but at the same time to the south is
United States has that history of being one of the more racist places of the whole United States
None
There was slavery and all of that. A certain minority of whites that hate any ethnic group and have their strange demonstrations
But things are strong like that
Of course.
They fight strong
Yes but.
Here it's not something massive.
In the rural parts of Georgia they saw things like were seen in the Ku Klux Klan
Yes, really.
Yes, still
None
And that those rare things but they are are very far the city
None
It's inside the city of Atlanta, one is a place more civilized and so those things, no.
None
Look what was happened
Oh, how strange
And how did you get to Idaho?
I married a gringo
Idaho
Yes. I was married to a gringo, that's how I came here.
Well, my mother married a Gringo
Yes?
Yes, because of that we went to Seattle in ninety one, I had eleven years.
None
My dad stayed in Chile and that is why I come and go like that.
Oh, okay.
Clearly.
Okay.
And a
Okay
Interesting.
You are single?
Something like that, we live together
None
Of course clearly.
What do you call it do you like it or not
Yes, because or its like I am in the city, I like it more city because I am from the city or the country. For example I lived in San Rafael I don't know if you're familiar but
He walked from San Felipe to the Andes which is more rural
None
Typical Chilean country and that enchanted me.
Yes
Like to be in the city because it is it is more hip, there are more things to do
I don't know, this makes me
None
Then
Esta bien
Yes
It's not like
But
It's super drastic change for me to come here
Yes, I imagine
Because I was accustomed to live in the city, and here, But there is a city near I could find all I need but the life is more
Is more calm.
Sure
More calm and everything, just it is not good because for example, there is not so much crime as in a bigger city grande
Sure
But is kind of bored
Yes, I imagine
Kind of
But the same in touchm is hard too
Same but small Chico
Hello Juan Marcela.
Hello. How are you? My name is Juan. Marcela.
None
Didn't we talk?
I think so. You are in Texas and I am in North Carolina.
Yes. I. Pleasure.
None
I have not forgotten you. Did we practice together?
Yes.
Do you have social security here? Are you covered?
I am covered through my husband.
None
And the children are covered  so we are alright.
We are not.
Is it a problem, no?
We are not covered. It is a problem because well something can always happen, no?
We are very healthy but you never now.
Yes the other day i went precisely to an office in which supposedly they gave you some type of pension for
People in the community
Yes.
The papers that they asked with my address and proof of work. Finally they found an excuse to not give it to me because they asked
To give information abut the person who was hiring me and the person didnt want to give out the information
None
In my case I have a son who has epilepsy.
None
This is what I believe that they need , people nowadays, have patience and
And they didn't give you the attention?
No. They didn't want to describe me really. Then in the cases if I price with him, he was sick one time. He got worse.
I went back to Mexico and sought medical attention from my doctor.
None
And they prescribed them once I ran out of medication. I normally buy it in Mexico.
It can be cheaper.
It is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me medical samples
That helps
Then yes, it is something that we think there should be some kind of more flexible, no, so if there is a community but it is a certain kind of community.
Yes. No, I think that the whole system is going to have to fall before they do something different. Because I think that it is too difficult to fix it because there are
The costs of everything depend on demand. If these costs are rising and rising
Yes
Because there is more demand and because people pay it. And then they raise the costs because people ask more money and people who work ask for more money, it is a vicious circle. And then how can suddenly they can have socialized medicine?
Yes.
It is impossible.
Yes. It should be
Money does not stop being like a drug, you see. They are already used to a certain amount of money.
None
Suddenly, they are not going to have it.
Exactly. It is a problem, it is a circle that works with the earnings here it is stronger, isn't it?
Yes of course it is.
Than it's more ugly.
We would stop making bombs and going to war. All of that money that could be used
None
For school or on a medical system, of social medicine
If they would lower it just a little bit.
Yes
I don't know where are you living there. But nurses and doctors who are having money lives here. Isn't it?
Yes, well nurses are paid very well because few nurses, there are less
So here, as the say, time and good care with a woman that is around thirty years old, for example. No?
None
Is an nurse and it passes. When you find out if they are really nurses.
Yes. Tell me, thirty dollars an hour.
It is my understanding that Canada have more medicine to offer.
None
Then any Canadian resident has rights to medical services, just to be there and they don't have any economical consequences
No, but the difference is that they started right.
Yes, exactly.
It's like Argentina, my parents have all the medical bills paid
None
All medical coverage is paid, they pay a little amount
The one thing we should make is at least paying something
Yes
Having some type of social security, but even that is really
It is really expensive.
It's expensive right?, I don't know how drugs are here, but in Mexico is cheaper.
All over the world
There is more competition in drugs.
Yes. When we moved here we couldn't find the drug my son was taking.
None
So, we went to Argentina last year, I went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here
I bought it there for twelve dollars.
Yes
12 dollars, same company and everything.
Yes.
And it could have been less if I bought the unknown brand.
Same
But, I don't understand
In Mexio for example, my son's medicine has five or six brands
None
With similar ingredients
None
And here there's only one. And second that in the literature is not the best. And listen but only the laboratories, I thought that all the American laboratories well
At the time of the competition there's a monopoly.
Yes
Big interest in everthing
That's true. It really is true.
None
According to things
But
According to what specialty they have to operate here. You know what you would have to do?
Yes.
Why don't you contact an organization that is called the Shriners?
Yes.
None
Yes, I already know
Because they help the children.
None
Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease, or if they cover everything because perhaps
None
You can communicate with them and say he hears we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation.
Yes.
The shriners are didicated to helping for themedical care of children
Yes.
Of the parents who can't pay.
Yes he knew of that. He hears, what already it was time or what?
The twelve minutes seem like half an hour.
I noticed that.  Yes I only knew and thought it was for me.  I was much smaller without you tiring and for more style.
Yes. Perhaps uncertain but not to find out it cost nothing
I am going to crash.
Also if you call to Catholic Charities
That, yes.
Perhaps they have something that can help you.
Yes it's very simple because in reality, good on the one hand the maintenance is a medicine that this person who helped me with the sample says no man this
Here they give them to us, you have no problem. Just go to the community center.
None
There are many samples. And knowing a bit more about the advances, I can give the medicine, we think that a deeper diagnosis could improve the life of my son.
With the epilepsy
Sure.
Because it was under control, but lately it has been nearly two years in which it has been uncontolled.
Of course he's getting older and the medicine has no impact anymore, we may need to try a different one.
And what are you going to do about it? Work's first.
None
Yes,, we was very ill
What a thing.
Yes, it's a matter of experimenting.
And you, you must live with your hearts in your mouth.
Yes, sometimes yes.
And that causes a lot of stress.
Always yes.
Much stress
Even if you don't say it your always looking after him, all the time.
Yes
No?Being a teenager my poor son is in a trauma hoping it does not happen.
None
It happens at school so he feels really bad
Of course, he is ashamed, How old is he?
Yes it is a heavy load, it's a really heavy load for him.
How old is he?
17
Oh, it's just a teenager.
There must be a good one here.
Yes. Do you know where you can ask? At teaching hospitals
System of
At medics, at teaching centers in medical schools.
None
At those places, plenty of times at different apartments.
Yes
Financially limited people are provided help in order to get a consultation with a specialist doctor.
None
And we do not have
Is it.
They take note of whatever they give us and after that they charge.
A reasonable account. Something we can afford, sometimes they don't even charge at all
None
That's interesting. I had to get an abscess checked. It turns out, I have ADD.
Yeah
In the end I found here the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina
Yeah
And they didn't charge me anything and they performed all the tests on me.
Really?
Yes
Everything is very well, to which orientation are we going, the place I went to precisely is called University System, healthcare system
Yes their imagination
It's precisely there where they bounced me.
With the University
I told him
But what a thing
They told me no, you have to give us information. I had a letter with my earnings.
None
But,not that we need the social security of your employer. Then thats when they didn't want ot anymore
They didn't want to give you that information.
No? not me. now I have my social security, myself.
Maybe now you can.
Yes, employed
None
Maybe I'll go.
Maybe now you can
None
Hello how are you? my name is John
Matt here.
I am in San Antonio Matt, I think we have spoken before, you are in Philadelphia?
Yes you are
It's a pleasure to speak with you again.
Yes, how have you been?
Everything is fine what do you think about today theme?
I didn't listen what is the theme
The theme is technical devices that is the devices we use more and depend of them and how do you consider these dependency.
In your daily life, if it became more of a problem than a solution
This includes cars?
Its the same issue that i was thinking, sure they must added
Yes, because it is a machine
Yes, if the cars seem to be important then
Yes the most obvious it's the computer, but it's not the only one
Exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element, depending on the case. So it can be a car, no, because the computer is a tool, every time more
So more than once, we said that belongs to the institution where you are no? its more than a tool work
None
Seems like a car
Yes. You buy a car and you are using it, have to maintain it, always a part of your life.
Why, do you need to look after the car yes, do you know ?
Yes yes, exactly, besides as I'm here in Texas
None
I feel that the automobile culture is like a reminiscence of horses
Did you use the horses more?
No? It's like a horse, it is something very close and personal.
Yes
Over the course of one's life, we take care of them and it's very important just like a horse from that time
Yes
For some years yes, because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age, like computers
As permitted by the information management?
Yes, because up here in Texas...
But
You need the car, do you know? For work
Yes
Then
Exactly and here the working people are like in those days, like mules, they need a pickup truck
Yes
There's a work culture that's very important
I see.
And the computers.  In practically all houses there is television, telephone and computers.  But it's not like there are other dimensions of the technological question.  Then the car seems to be
The most important
The questions on the subject were which
What a technical question is this!. Technology is most import in your life. Which one would you like to have a car or a computer? What do you think?
For me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
Exactly.
I am with it, I have my cellular.
None
When she is criticized I tell her, God loves you like you are, but you cannot be criticizing everyone.
None
I didn't have a cellphone until I was twenty years old, now that I live in Philadelphia I'm not always at home
I'm not always going back home just to look at my messages
Yes
Okay always always I am, always I have my cellphone
You have your cellphone
I think that it's very surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone, here in the United States
Yes, it's important what you said. I think working with computers is challenging and important.
Yes
In the computer there were the messages.
Yes
The computer was the most important.
But now,
The type of work that I am realizing is the auto which is the most important like the computer. Because the computer does more typing work than what I am doing.
More physical. The auto is converted in the apparatus. The computer, for a second diagram, is also very important.
But is by the type of good work.
Me I think working for Texas  I undertand that there is more like land there.
More space
Yes
In the city, having an auto can be convenient.
Yes
Because always you have to try to park and to have to pay a lot to park. And the gas station is not close by and I do not know it.
Is more one problem that one torque, that one helped obviously. Understand?
Oh, yes?
It is better to have an auto, I think.
Yes, for the distance that needs to go in the job, the auto is fundamental.
Clear.
Maybe it can be a computer?
The next questions, the apparatus of communication.
None
The other question is if you consider that those technologies will convert more into a problem than, than in
Well, what type of problems would it have, no? Like you just said, with the car. The problems that have to do with parking.
None
Here in Texas where I am there are no major problems. With parking there is a lot of space everywhere. It still does not have the
Issues with cars are not seen as a large problem unless it is
We could consider as a problem the interests created around auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
Transport, no?,
Don't you think it's great that it has changed in sixty years?
Yes
If we look seventy-five years ago, there were no cars, but these days almost everybody has
Yes.
And the same thing with the computers they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until, like ten years, because
Since
Because they have the things very advances and the things have not
Yes
I got paid for the their development cost. Do you understand me? I don't know how to explain it to you very well.
Exactly yes, well as they say as well, with the auto industry, no? is the auto industry would have advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry maybe the car could transport us with
One hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
None
No, nd instead of costing twenty thousand dollars it would cost you two thousand dollars
Yes
Industry has its own interests, it moves on. They're talking about hybrids now.
A lot of them say that they are not affordable. It's really a matter of image that companies do, and when it comes to see the return tables
I though they would be a lot more efficient.
Yes
No? no, I don't think they have a real, that they are a really big technological breakthrough, given the efficiency that
Yes, that was a very important breakthrough.
Excuse me?
You don't think it's an important breakthrough
I don't think it's so important. The efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars
None
According to the tables, an economical car will give you maybe thirty-six miles per gallon
Yeah
And a Hybrid can give you fifty
There are cars like Ford.
NONE
The pickup trucks no because they are changing them so they can be more efficient, you know?
None
Ant time here, surely you dont like it.
Yes exactly and and sure, and but, at the same time for example with those autos of there have been small cars that give you almost the same mileage than the hybrid, and they are not hybrid, isn't it?
New small cars that are not in the North American market, that are in the European or Latin American market have to be much more efficient.
Yes
And smaller, no? so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a smaller European car, or of the ones that circulate in Latin America so then
It is much more expensive to have a car because of the initial cost. While it will be saved a lot in gas, it end up
Being less than what a good economy car has?
And, why is it that
European
Why is the United States one of the few nation that has this, only here you have those huge cars.
Yes, it is.
In other countries everybody has small cars
Yes.  Years ago in the 80's when there was a problem with petroleum, I recall
None
I thought if there was going to be a change in the culture, it was because they started to develop smaller cars here in the United States.
Yes, but
I thought well, there is going to be a change in the culture, but that was a thing of only the moment, no? it seems because it has some huge cars, they continue like
I'm Ana Maria
Faviola, hi
Hello Faviola.
How are you?
Fine and you? How's the weather there where you're at?
Great, it's sunny but cold.
Sunny and cold.
Cold
It's bad here, really cold. What do you think about movies?  Have you already talked about that subject?
Yes
I've talked about that subject before
Yea I've talked about it and I've talked about the one I remember specifically talking about was about violence.
None
They didn't like the idea of going to see movies. And I told them, that the world has violence.
None
I've had the chance to teach children about peace and love with their TV or in the world.  Later when they go out into the real world at school.
They find that kids hit each other, that they don't know how to defend themselves.
None
So I think that it's OK that they rate the movies how they do, I think it's the responsibility of adults, even where their kids can watch TV.
I agree,  the most important responsibility of parents.
They are doing their movie jobs.
They are earning their money. What is your job?
It's his business.  You
Doing his business, yes
He doesnt want to see him anymore it is not thier responsibility they see
Yes
That they sell
Yes
It is the fault of those that buy it.
Yes, because of that
Yes
The biggest responsibility is of the parents.
Because there is a classification of a movie PG thirteen
Yes
And you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility
Yes
It is because you let him and you thought what can be done.
Exactly
The association is the one who puts the classifications already
Yes, we believe  the same thing in that Faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising, taking are of and wanting them to see or not see
Your sons or your family.  You, as a mother, or your husband as a mother.
I believe also that I agree completely and the other, normally the children have access to television when the parents are out
Exactly
The kids are alone
None
There is no father to teach them or tell them you should not watch this, you should watch
Or if they go to a sleepover, you don't know either
You don't have any idea
If they go to a sleepover and watch a movie they don't have any control at that house
You don't know either
Exactly
It is important to give your children one, then teach them. They respect those signs if you give them good principles at home.
Sure
I don't like. You watch or the time will come
Because as they say, they cannot have them in a crystal box
No
Go, exposed
Yes, also when children reach a certain age.  My son was about sixteen years old when he told me, don't worry, you did better than you could have
None
It is twenty five percent genes and education, the rest is the decision of my life.
With that
Of course, then I leared. Oh wait, no, I was and
None
My cellphone was ringing, let me answer it.
Okay
Don't hang up on me we have to talk for twelve minutes.
Yes
I only went to turn it off.
Okay
I think about movies I love to Watch horror movies
OK
But there are times when I get scared I'm an adult.
You, you scare yourself,
I get scared and I go find out horror movies.
Your responsibility is to watch it. You scare yourself.
Yes
I don't watch any of that violent.
Yes. That's why I respect what my son told me that time. Fifty percent is responsibility.
Yes
You already did the best you could, but then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen
That some are much more mature than normal
Yes
And they starts seeing R-rated movies
None
At around fourteen and fifteen years old. The eleven and twelve year olds are already seeing the PG-13 shows.
Yes, there
And even sometimes even the little ones. And even sometimes the much younger ones because I remember of Jenny's little friend who used to watch Harry Potter and it's
Already thirteen already
-PG thirteen, PG fourteen Jenny doesn't like it because she gets scared.
Yeah
She gets scared with the monsters.
Yes
But I am in accordance, that the major part is, the criteria that you form and that way in the end.  Take care of them and don't let them watch television when they are by themselves.
Yes because
Don't leave them alone with the t.v.
Imagine the same we can't control them
It's the television more then.
That's why I'm tell you, you can control them, you can't see this movie because of this and this reason. because you need to be more mature or whatever you want to tell them, it's not true.
You have to have a formulated criteria to go and see some movies.
Yes, that's why I'm telling you that you don't get [anything] in telling them. There will come a time in which they go to a house like a friends house.
In the same school they show them movies
Or the same school.  It is under a little more supervision because there is a goal.
They show them documentaries.
What I fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses. They have the television or the computer right there.
And they have access to the information without the parents having any idea at all. And they are in the piece and the parents think they are listening to music
Maybe they are watching something non-adequate. That's why I say, if my son or daughter or whoever
Is presented to that situation it needs to learn to value itself. And learn to answer to that. That's what I say, therefore trying, trying to give the values of the house
Keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and kill himself
You know they are not ready for that
It wanted to fly. No, I don't want to ask you a question
None
Did you read the rules for this game, the telephone game
Yes, OK
I was wondering who is this and are you ready for christmas already?
I am getting ready and buying the presents for the family but i have another things in my mind
Of course about your birthday no
Yes I am getting ready buying presents for the family for the neices then there is only the adults left
Buy things for the adults, an attention, although I'll make most of the presents
That's what I was going to tell you.
I'm going to cook, yes,
Cooking and sewing but sewing given to me
Yes, also for some children too.
Not that thing in the table.
Yes, but I don't have time to wait until the middle week of December to do it.
Because they are
I don't use it
That is beautiful.
Yes, so that is what I'm going to do. That's why I'm going to do some gifts, Andreita that is her about to be her birthday soon.
Two days before Miranda.
It's Andreita's birthday
Have some nice memories in life about the achievements that you had
It was about three days.
I have a little gift for her
For what did you buy Miranda?
A screen that you draw and then you erase.
Oh it's nice
She already knew them, she likes them. She makes little dashes, then erases them. I'm not going to give them to her yet because they are very small. She puts them in her mouth.
But the screen and the pencil, yes.
Oh that's nice
But yes, because little things like this.
What a feeling.
You and Andreita enjoy the same types of things.
Do you know who else's birthday.
Okay, who?
The same date
Who?
I remember when I was there
My father-in-law, that
Your father-in-law, yes.
It is true. Who?
The, Juan Luis Sandra's younger son.
Oh yes
Also the twenty nine. I remember that everybody were there in the same date
I don't remember that he was in at least I did not know.
You went to the Carlistos' birthday
I have not gone to any birthday in Sandra's house. I was to one pure, I don't remember, really.
Once you went to Chile and left her a present, that was for her birthday,
Was in April, so, I went to Chile in April
That was another birthday. She is three.
I left the gift in that place
Yes, for her nephew who came later
Yes, he came and told me he later received it from her. But, no, I did not get his name.
Sandra won't throw a party this year for her birthday
Okay.
They will buy something better for the kid
It's true.
She makes really big parties.
It gets away from her hands
She spends too much in that, and that's why they cannot buy the kid
Yes that is exactly what he really wants.
They have to decide between the two things, so this year they decided that only the family
He could get a more special present
Of course, for a better gift
Is Juan Luis big or small ?
The smaller of all
Yeah.
He always says that he doesn't want any clothes
Oh poor boy!
He doesn't want books, only toys
Carolina
Tamara.
Tamara how are you ?
Yes and you?
Where are you?
I am in the State of Washington, Seattle
I am in Los Angeles.
Yes,
Yes it is incredible
Yes
I was making a call and did not think today was Sunday. I was more asleep than awake.
Yes they get me off guard,but do you have time participating here?
I believe that is my 23rd call!
It is almost ready.
Yes.  This is the second time I do this service with them.
I received mail from them that they are again accepting persons that can participate
Yes
No, did you get the same mail? Apparently this is going to continue from what you can understand on the mailing they sent.
Yes i am
Tell me
What do you think about what they show in the movies?
Tell me? Honestly, I have more than a year since we stopped seeing movies in the regular movies and we switched to the cinema
Not too conventional.
None
We switch to movies. We see documentaries with another kind of message.
None
You watch movies that are in Festivals. there is one for example recently ended the Latin American International Film Festival
It was
Yeah
Hello!
No, I am not here on my computer,
It has been a month since I told you we were not going to continue wasting time
Time, in the majority of the cases really they are movies with a rather stupid and absurd content and well we made the decision that we didn't want to waste either time or money.
OK
Watching a type of movies that really don't give you anything.
Yes there are lots of movies so, I have noticed
Yes
Around here where I live, there used to be one of those Hollywood Video or Blockbuster likes, but it was
Smaller
OK
They had movies like the ones they're talking about, documentaries and stuff, but they had to close since people won't go due to the big stores
Sure
My husband is from America but he likes international movies too
More important things to say
Exactly
They want to see some movies and we take them two or three times a month
Yeah
We reduced it, so it's now once or twice every two months
Okay. Same here, we used to go more or less once a month, we went to the movies very often and some day we watched a movie so
Stupid, so dumb that I felt angry at being at the theater. I was thinking, what are we doing here? what waste of time is this?
No. And then we started getting information about other kind of movies, we changed completely to that kind of movie. Actually ,right now we are in
In one of those phases, we are kind of intellectuals now, because we arrived at that point where you feel like
What are you doing? I mean, to watch this, I honestly prefer to go to sleep, or do something else instead of, not all movies, there are some that have
Movie is not worth watching
I think that eighty percent of movies are bad. You must not see them.
He have to make 10 movies. We'll make then movies, it doesn't matter how, or when, just
Making them up as they go along. Where are you from?
I am from panama
I'm from Venezuela
Okay
Yes.
If it is real
We say that to the spot no that good, yes make the movies how you want but if some come out good and others if they are not
Honestly, no. And the same is happening right now with the television. We had cable and recently in a matter of a month, we cut it off because all of a sudden
That we got against that we see that there was a lot of manipulation in the media they only give you the news they want and hide what they want
That's a level of news and movies, but the money is average
But they were repeating and repeating, and repeating oh my God what is this we are paying for this then is kinda annoying right now
With the means of communication we are like this,yes
Yes, my husband and I watch news
I believe
Because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid
Exactly
Or do they exagerate a lot
Exactly.
We would be in Panama before Noriega got out of Panama
Just imagine
That white man white bought paper with my dad is dark and my mom is white and i came out dark like my dad
Did you know he was American when we went out?
Logic
We'd go in both, to the military base and our prioritized destionations
Of course
Suddenly, we got home and turned the TV on. There was a bunch of stuff going on at Panama. I looked at him
I will be there at morning.
Exactly.
The next day it was the same, and i say: oh what an ex-agent!, I think they where showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating
Exactly
He doesn't want to believe what the TV says
Exactly.
The news, none of that; I tell my kids don't believe everything TV says.
Exactly
Because it's not true, and this
I borrowed a movie that's called Panama's deception or Panama's Defense
Right
Noriega's problem and the documentary were so sad.
Ugly what happened
That was the documentary about that men that got his head cut off
I have become accustomed to having a cellular telephone
It isn't remembered
I can't remember exactly, but what I can remember is that night when they bombed, a lot of people died.  A few days ago they showed a
A recall now during our President's visit
None
He was there and the people was protesting that why? The current President did nothing to remember the victims of that sector.
They were named Los de Richos. De Chinos is the sector where practically all the town disappeared.
Del churillo
Del Chorrillo, exactly
Yes, Where the police station was
In that place you say, almost happens the same in Venezuela with the current President. There are happening things that you know are happening to us.
Those things are put here in Venezuela and happens.
Don't be so shameless,don't put those things there
He is nuts.  The information is being twisted and he is being shown like a monster, a
We have been through four elections and four Referendum. It is his personality
Iis uncommon and then people don't accept that. And he is not a common person and people don't accept that, then he is the first critical of all that stuff
Yes that.
I dont know if you have heard him
No, like I told you, i'm not too interested in the new
There is a page on the internet where you can watch television from all the countries including Panama. It is called
TV for all
TV
Four all
Yes, theater.
Four is a number
None
TV number four all
TV or TV for all
Exactly, there you go
With
It is dot com, yes
OK
There you see the programming of all the channels of the world. Then of course Panama and Venezuela. Now I see the Venezuelan television.
But specifically I watch the chanel from the government there. Because the other channels are from the opposition, then of course it is a little bit more of the same.
I like to watch what horrific things they are saying.
OK
Since I have this Internet page now I don't turn on the television.
The whole world, a bit like for comparing, what is going on and even we are doing it with radio, we're listening to community radio, that you feel like you
Let's not say it's the truth one hundred percent because sometimes it isn't.
I don't know, it's not that you can say everything the others say is not but
None
They manipulate it too much
Yes
I don't know if you
Say?
You gave yourself a, I don't know if you watched a movie called Auto fox
I don't remember.
It is a documentary about those who work in Fox News
None
And they forced them to say what its not and they decided to resign from the channel. They also got together and started to protest at a level
Well, at the level of, locally to tell the world what was going on inside Fox News. It's very interesting, it's called something like
The Fox workers that are out.
Some
Outside
None
From Fox News
My name is
Hi, my name is Fernanda
How are you, my name is claudia
How are you?
Where are you talking from?
From Washington
Which one?
Washington, DC
Because there are two of them?
Yes, Washington State
And the other one
Where are you from?
I'm talking from Idaho, i don't know if you know it
Of course
Yes, personally movie ratings don't impact my choices.
They don't know how to rate them. For example, sometimes they said that it is a PG movie, but when you watch it
Has rude things, and pornography, and sometimes something stronger like a PG-13 is more quiet
None
People who rate those movies, don't know how to rate them, or I don't know what are their point of view
Yes, I really don't know that much about movies because.
None
Let's say I dont have any children so I barely ever notice.
None
What classification
None
But I think that the majority of TV is, during the middle of the day is when children are usually at home
None
Are things that are not appropriate for most
Yes
I think that Americans have no moral standards, standards have gone down.
Yes
Many things already are like normal that I think should not be.
I don't have cable.
None
I got to have cable one time, which ones do you like? ten am, eleven, and well I I like to be changing the channel
To choose the program I am going to see for what time
None
A nine year old boy was at home watching TV.
Stop on that channel, there were things like very for adults already
Sure
Thought about the children,  have been married three years and I have a boy who is almost two years old.
OK
My son is going to grow up and maybe this is going to get worse. Then
Of course
I remember that once I was watching television. I am from Mexico City.
None
It was ten at night then i turned on , i had cable there and i learned the cable
To the channel that here is sixteen, there was a cartoon in English. Because at night they show some in English, some in Spanish
There were cartoons in English. my mom was quiet because he was watching a cartoon channel.
The cartoons started to show up naked.
None
The cartoon was starting to do things the two cartoon figures, it was ten at night,
What a horror
She turned the television off and well she had to explain a bit because my mom, it surprised her because I had turned to a cartoon channel, a normal channel.
The truth, not even cartoons are safe.
That could happen to any child who was watching television
Sometimes cartoons yes
And you cannot either be on top of if the kid changes you cannot jump to see, you have to trust that at least during the day
Yes
Programming does not contain nudity or curse words.
Yes, it's true. But really it's not the cartoons, the Japanese cartoons are are the ones that have more classification. In Mexico,
In Cablevision and Multivision that would be what cable here to there in Mexico  it hasn't all those restrictions. But, for example, in normal tv's, with normal channels
Yes, it has more restrictions. Not so much now on the children's channel.
Any channel  what is the five in cartoons
Yes
Then at ten of clock, eleven, and you can watch TV and they don't put on programs so ugly like that.
In Mexico District
In Mexico
Pornography thing or with more nudity.
I'm Colombian and in Colombia
None
The TV is a lot better there than it is here in that way.
Right
At ten p.m. the show they put on are never, you're not at risk.
Right
Please do not risk watching anything else.
I was with a neighbor. It was twelve and a half p.m.
Her kid was watching a cartoon channel after that the girl wanted to change the channel and, it was another channel that was also programmed for them
There is a program where there was a girl who showed their adventures and that was in a hospital
It went right there in the hospital, they were showing her mom was having her little brother.
Yes?
But it showed and I went and told her mom and she told me, there's no problem, it's a channel of
The cartoons did not leave much to the imagination.  They showed an operating room where a woman was having her baby.
What horror
They were six years old.
Yes
They are twins and so are both six years old
What they want.  Honestly if i dont want to explain too much to my children in that moment I keep watch more.
What they see, no? In that aspect.
There are babysitters and things like that you dont have control and you are not in the house to see
None
You don't know what they're watching. They go to their friends.
Yes or no
I think
Yes, it is one of those classifications that is used for television.
They don't leave anything to the imagination. They show it right away.
Yes
At any time of day, you watch soap operas. I don't like watching soap operas.
Many moms are at home and they have little children three, four years old, five or more or they're at home and they watch, they're watching their soap opera
They always show scenes where  they're having relations.
None
And in the middle of the day, because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall.
Of course
That's how they are. They don't leave anything to the imagination.
No, I
So, the programs, are classified, to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal. And for many
Parents, unfortunately, are making it normal.
Exactly
And I believe that if the parents spoke to this television station and demanded that there were more strict programs of this type of scene
I believe that they would decrease a little. But anyways, not now or , until parents if their children see something like that, it's okay, it's no problem.
It doesn't matter to them
Teaching. These things of classifications I don't like. I believe it doesn't matter to the producers. I feel that to them its beneficial because
If a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people, they buy it or the people see it and they even laugh,
Or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene. So really, these things sometimes even help more.
The producers are going to sell.
Sometimes, and
If that's the case, no. For me in particular, the type of movies that I like, in truth I really like Disney movies, the
Children's movies. I like them.
Yes
I have some Disney movies around here but don't like these movies even though I am tired.
Strong so that, that have many things of, of sex and all that because equally, I repeat to you that I am going to have more kids and while I am not going to be and
And at least if they are going to put on a movie, it should at least be a decent movie. One that does not have so many things.
Of course.
That is so that while we have those from Disney, at least they are going to be have pornography, right? Then well,
She does not know how they are going to change.
No, yes then, already, this is the truth, this is bringing the truth far as it already goes. You turn on the television and you already see a commercial.
All seemed fine when they had the feminine towels, until they also had a naked woman.
She is placing the towel
Exactly
Because sometimes until they show it to you. I don't know if you have seen the commercials that. Likewise/Equally it frightens you because you are big, right? but..
If a boy or a girl is seeing it if it is the mom and you can answer, and if it is the friend (boy or girl)
You tell them that you can explain to him about the bad information
And that one becomes acostomed to it. We say
Then already - yes
So that sometimes I see and like that one does not realize how they have changed things
Good evening my name is Mariza from Philadelphia
Hello, my name is Juan are you Marisol
Mariza.
I see Mariza, we talked a few days ago I think, no.
Maybe yes
I could be. I am in San Antonio, Texas.
In San Antonio.
The theme for today is about religion, right?
That is a complicated and controversial theme
I think everyone needs religion
None
Like any other need, the institution is tired of
Yes
Give us answer. And ends been like a way to control, no.
Es really today in this country. Eh, In the United States there is a lot, lot of problems regarding religion, it is a mix with politics and lot of right side people that want to have control.
Tried to control the country based on religion.  It can be positive or it can be negative to people.  It helps to pray or believe, to help others.
Christianity is the most powerful religion in the world. There are more that have power to have influence in politicians, to the countries
Yes.  Where I live, I went to a church
None
That, they express a project of, ideology, but regarding a conservative group in the United States, no.
Yeah
Then they exerted a power very direct, very sure, trying to influence people there at the church
Yeah
With the discourse, it came to my attention against the public schools
None
Directly against the public schools.  Praying for God to free us from public school some day
Really?
Do you think it's better there than Miami?
No
And against the theory, about trying to see the theory of evolution, no
Oh I've heard that, yes.
No, terrible they said. Why is this excruciating the teachers that teach the Bible to explain the creation of the world?
There ar a lot of problems
The Bible does not make for an explanation of the world.
Everyone can believe what they want. They try to impose their beliefs to everyone for the Bible and for what they think.
Exactly, they're fundamentalisms
I know some people from Maracaibo.
Christians are the ones with power in the country, the ones with the companies, there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away.
The right to abort, for example another question was homosexuality, gay marriage, the right to the belief of
Yes, more scientific, no, no, you can't just believe what they say, that God created man and woman, you also have to give a choice for kids to believe,
That was Charles Darwin who came up with the theory of evolution.
Yes
And it's really complicated too. The other question was about homosexuality. If we were all equal or we all believed the same thing there wouldn't be any problems. I was asking.
But
As similar as we are, there may be more problems.
Yes
In that sense, the differences help to complement each other.
For me, I don't have any.
The subject of homosexuality is very controversial.
None
At any given time the tolerance of homosexuality has to be something that we're well informed about. I used to think that
It could have something ot do with a deviation, homosexuality, but lately I've read tht it's a matter of genetics.
I'm convinced that's the reason, it's very common
No
I am really informed and so i never know about homosexuals or lesbians since i was a girl
I would accept people for, I never thought they were better or worse for being homosexual and that everyone has the right to to, well I don't know, well to get married, to,
Well yes,
To be with whoever they want. It's the same if it's a man or a woman. I think that we all have the same rights because we're all citizens and pay the same taxes.
Yes
They have to have the right to get married, to live with whoever.
Yes I agree with you, exactly I think that, they have all the rights, because we can have any other type of person and in this case the marriage rights are relative
Well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they don't have rights to marriage, no really when marriage is really a contract
None
Between two persons that stated doing something in common.
The church won't see it that way.
No,
Believe that it is an abomination because marriage is define as the union between a woman & a man, the christian fundamentalist see it as an abomination, they are so closed mind that they don't understand that
Homosexuality has been always, since the beginning of man
As the things are more liberal,people arent scared to talk about their gender
The Church has a problem, but they cannot do anything.
None
People is accepting the echo from people, like he is homosexual
Right, yes like there is one that is so extreme,, the family and marriage, the ecclesiastic institution and the blessing of God for marriage and things when in reality
The church and religion is a way of institution like school
Right.
The need to change and find new ways learning.
Yes
From society and individuals, no.
Yes, the religion has to be something personal, no something that mix with politics, what you believe is each one, doesn't have to be what,
Let's see why you don't think the same as me, you are not me, you get punished because we are different and it shouldn't be like that, each person can think whatever they want, believe in anything or anyone, don't have
The Christians talk badly about the Muslims. They say they are radicals. They talk badly about the atheist because they don't believe in god. They call them heretic.
I don't know.
Right
Christians are supposed to accept everyone, regardless of their religion. But fundamentalists don't accept the differences.
Yes, but in that case, accepting the difference seems like something that has to do with the matter of humanity right
None
They can't accept the difference.
Yes, because the families say that they raise their children when they are very little to be like that.
When they are older and know that people are different, they say, no that is not right, because they taught me like that, and that is how they have to be.
Radicals don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them.
Yes
I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races and cultures, so I am very open to everything
Right
And so, when I see a person who is not, I immediately know, only by looking at them I say, this person will not accept me because I'm not like them. I don't think the same, I don't look the same.
But is that there are people of different classes and there has to be radical Christians. There has to be everything. But I think that, yes, religion does influence the country.
Yes influences a lot, what fascinates me is that in this case
Yes
In this country, being so fundamentalist
Yes
There is a great proportion of fundamentalist even in the discourse  there are fundamentalists
Of course, yes
Not there,
The message is very clear and it's already been five years in government. When Bill Clinton was in government, he was more open. He was leftist, a person more
That understood more people's concerns and, this government let's say that they don't have the religious Christians of the right that is the ones that are
Saying how to do things in the country which is why there's such a polemic with marriages. And they want the supreme court judges to be religious and from the right
To be or Catholic they also want that, they take away the right to abortion is ridiculous at this century.
None
They want that things go backwards instead of going forward. They want things as they were thirty or forty years ago and that cannot be.
That's how we are now.
Do you practice any religion in particular?
In Spain as soon as you're born they baptize you, so I got married in the Church
Sure.
I have my beliefs, but I don't go to mass every Sunday, neither do I practice
I carry faith with me
Yes
I am catholic believer.
Sometimes I get closer with the Catholic church, it is temporary because they
Created interests in everyone.
Yes, there is much economic interest.
No, then
It is that it goes right away that they are not interested on the followers, they are interested on money
Yes
There have been many cases of child abuse
A priest doing that to a child there is much polemic regarding that
Yes
Let's say faith. I don't know that each person is free to believe what he wants, and practice it, but also respecting other who are not the same.
None
The Christian religion is the most abundant in the world
Because in the world we have, on this side of the world I believe that not even the majority of Christians, I believe there are more Muslims than Christians.
Yes, but they don't have as much economic power.  That is the problem.
None
Hi, good night
Yes, good night.
Good night. My name is Carolina.
How are you Carolina? talk to Alex
How about Alex?
Of Los Angeles
Very good, I'm from New York.
Okay, I thought you were the other person. Okay?
None
I am here in Los Angeles
Well and good
Gladly.
Tonight we played the technical equipment.

I am an administrator and for my job I use the computer.
The most essential, and above all, and new techniques, no? new technologies that have come and every day more new things come up, no?
Yes.
The truth is that I have adapted very well and I love it since I've been using the computer, because before I used a type writer that was so slow to
Write documents and forms. Now everything is done through the computer and the Internet. It's something amazing.
Or me, it's essential, I think that I wouldn't know what to do without computers, no? So, the truth is that I'm very happy with this new technology, and I hope it keeps going
Forward more every day.
I believe they have made more advancements in the computer that they have made with medicine.
That's true
The computer is the most advanced of civilization now.
It's all one.
Yes.
I use it for my work and also when I'm at home. I need
Some information, well I sit down in front of the computer and there's no stopping me, I don't know, when it's like with something, an essential part of one's life, no?

Yes, almost then the computer has a lot of influence.
Right, and how many calls have you made?
This is my twenty-second call.
You are finished.
I almost need about three, but one call that the person spoke more in English,I think is going to have a replacement.
Now.
But, who knows?
Now
Because I spoke in Spanish, then they should consider.
Now
Because if you speak in English, they do not count it.
They give you the payment after you finish the twenty-five calls?
Yes, you do one call to replace.
Yes, now
I went to speak with him because I know the owner
NONE
And I am going to ask if it will be on me to replace it.
Do you know the owner?
Yes.

Oh, yes this is the second.
Yes.  What we're doing right now is technology
None
They are doing phone line connections.
Yeah right, and the other was almost equal, twenty five calls ?
And this is technology yes, something like that, was the same thing, but in English
They payed you equally?
Yeah, they paid the same.

It is the only time of the day I speak Spanish.
Yes.
I speak very little Spanish.
None
Yes.
Yes.
And what
Yes, of course it is.
This could not be done for about twenty or thirty years. What are we doing now?
Yes.
Because they are using multiple telephone lines to connect many people living in different parts of the country.
Exactly
I think phone technology has made progress because I can also make long distance phone calls, and I do not have to pay.
A monthly fee
Yeah.
You can make all the calls you want.
But here in
That was not in five or ten and twenty years
Here in the United States.
Here in the United States, yes
Yes, I have just received from Verizon that they are offering me free calls here in the United States.
Yes.
Hey give me and in the meantime they charge me.
If they charge you something monthly, but if you make a lot of calls, it's worthwhile.
None

How good it was.
You pay a monthly quote and make all the calls you want

That yes, I know that yes, what it is, you have to be with the clock
Yes.
Yes, but with
Yes, I have, the truth is that, hopefully technology continues moving ahead, I say that here in about ten years, what are they going to come up with, no?
Because like this has to be moving forward, no?
What happens is that like it is advancing and technology is in the hands of more people
None
Then services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
Sure, yes
Do you understand?
OF COURSE
For example, the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars.
Exactly yeah
Now you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars,
Yes that's true
Because there's more demand.
Of course.
Because technology has advanced.
Of course, that's true.
I would like to see
