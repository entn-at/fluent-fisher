That was speaking about if the lady would be leaving, if she believed that she was going to a party, and if her clothing would be very
Very colorful to go to a church, and her shoes were very high, that is she was so fixed up, it seemed that
Yes
She was going to, to a party that didn't seem to be in a church.
Yes
I looked at her and said,
Yes
If she loves God, why would she be talking about that.
You have to groom yourself to attend, as if you are going to a party.
None
It has nothing to do with God. When you go to church, you have to look nice.
None
All dolled up.
But it's not to, so that you use that to gossip about the others, if you are going to church
Exactly.
Gossiping about other people is somthing you should not do.

But I looked at her and said, Wow.  My God.  If she talks like that here, how does she.....

S
Working as a Spanish teacher assistant
Right.
But I'm also looking at what are the chances of going to school, to get a masters
That's good
You can live at home
Right.
Well, if you take advantage here, it's not bad.
Right. But no, in, in our countries it's not the same than here.
None
There's a lot of poverty and not so much work.
Yes, ma'am.
And here there isn't, you can get a job anywhere.

Then, my mom moved to Puerto Rico,
None
My young siblings went to Puerto Rico. I stayed here because I got married.
Yes.
But, my mom was coming and going. But, my mom doesn't like it here because of the cold.
I have heard that Chicago is pretty cold
But no, and she says that it's better that she is here placed in four corners, and in Puerto Rico she can be leaving and entering the house.
Yes
It's not the same.
Clearly. So her mom is in Puerto Rico now?
En Puerto Rico
Great
But my mom is Catholic and my aunt is Catholic
Yes
My uncle is Christian, he and my mom read the bible
Yes.
And he talks a lot of father God, and he asks my mom questions about God, and my mom responds
Yes
He doesn't like it because, after my grandfather died, my mom took out her eyebrows.
None
Made holes in her ear to put on earrings
None
She put them in the water and the children drowned.
Yes
And my grandfather, and my papa, and my uncle, they didn't like
None
Because he says that women should not use pants
Yes,
In his religion
Is he the brother of your
Of my mother
Mother, right?
He says that women should not use pants, because the pants were made for men.
Yes.
My uncle, is very religion fanatic
Yes
He has a religion
Yes
He does not tell his children to get in the religion
None
He only says things to my mother, and his sisters, his nieces, and his nephews, To his own children, he does not say anything.
Mhm.
I say to him to believe in God, you do not have to be seven days a week in church
Of course Madam
He is in church seven days a week.
Yes.
On Saturday, he says he's going to Church from the early morning.
None
Until the night, and all day Sunday in church.
None
He's fanatic about the church.
Yes ma'am.
I have a friend, she's Christian and she says she goes to the church
Yes.
None
Of course.
But, my uncle goes seven days a week.
Yes.
He's always talking about God
None
When I go to Puerto Rico, I always tell him
None
God, he's by our side twenty four hours a day.
Of course.
I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk to God, because even in your own bed, you can talk with God.
Yes mam
One can't continue asking God alone. We only remember God when we have problems and not all of the time.
Is
But there are some people that
Yes
My God that is, my God that grants me to be. When we are good, we don't have problems.
None
I don't believe that father God exists
I see
Hi?
Hi. Milgred from Connecticut.
It's Mercedes, from Florida
How are you, good night
Good night, too.
None
Let's see what we can talk about religion.
Do you believe that join or disjoints?
None
Or do you believe that if everybody were the same religion, we would be better or be equal? Or will it be
What I believe is that
The word will be better?
Somebody being the same religion that all we be the same religion it's impossible, because i think that always are going to be differences,cultural
Yeah, yeah
And that always is going to make it that each person interprets that unique religion in its own way
I believe that it may be the same because we are all different races.
It's doctrine, and although we are Hispanic some of us adquire another that in sometimes some of us are a catholic family, and others in the family are
Adventists or they are evangelical
YES
Or they are from the others. The ones of the taballas, the ones who sell... oh, what's their name? I forgot their name.
There is a lot of races and religions?
None
I don't get bothered with other religions. I share with any other religion as long as they don't try to put me in something I don't want.
Not including you.
Not being fanatics right.
They oppose it. Don't feel forced, right?
Yeah
I think the religion is separated because of difference.
People usually believe there are always differences.
Yeah, religion is like politics.
Exactly.
That depends on what point you look at it from.  Well, the entire work will be in agreement.  You understand?
That is why they say that one should never discuss religion. I can't believe they put us to discuss religion in this show.
I have aunts and cousins who belong the evangelic religion.
None
And the rest of them are Catholics.
Hm
And on the other side of my family, there are some who are absent.
Hm
No one is talking about religion or that you have to change
And my cousin's husband is an evangelical, you will almost always find him in the church. And she does not belong to the church. And they have a happier marriage than most.
She's only there for special occasions for mothers
They do not celebrate Christmas
Who are they?
Evangelicals.
Okay
Aha, yes, the evangelicals. So my cousin's husband says that he was not married by that religion, but they did get married at the church.
None
He dances, she drinks, and he accompanied her to work and to the party, where there was a present.
You haven't told anybody, you still have to stop smoking and you have to quit drinking protein.
If you make jokes about yourself at the party, rather than getting cranky? You know that this is not a big deal, and you should just have a good time.
You can get a person like that, but if they become fans, forget about it.
This is what happened in my house
That is
Hey, my mom is that religious
None
My dad did not believe in church. He never said why.
Hat is like my cousin
We all went to Catholic school.
Really?
Christians
Uh
That is what we learned in school, we didn't reinforce at home.
Yes
Now I think that  of my sisters, only the oldest is still Catholic. My younger sister is Evangelical, and I have decided that I do not have religion
That is, you're not going to Church or anything.
No.
No
Uh huh, no.
I am going to the church, but I'm not with what they call a pious woman who is stuck at the church all the time. No.
Hmmm. Not I, since I was married. I went to the university, and I left the university. I already decided that I wasn't going to return to the
I do not go to church, I am no interested in organized religion.
You don't like it.
I don't like it   I don't feel the necessity . I feel that God, I keep Him in my heart
Yes
I live my life well. I married my husband, he's Jewish and my son is Jewish too. We're going to bring him up Jewish.
Uh huh.
Because I do believe that one needs to grow up with a religion
Yes, I think that it's a very important base, especially for the children.
Yes, definitely. I
One raises them and forgets that they leave and beome half wild.
Hmm.
They don't have like feelings. I mean, the don't create a relationship with feelings towards anything/
Yes
It's like they don't care about anything.
Yes, that's why I agree that kids do well. And that's why they say
You say that you're a Christian and that what a miracle that they accepted you in his family, seeing that Jews almost always
Yes? Yes they are, really.
They are, how do you say it
Yes. We were lucky.
They have the same religion, so they try to marry only among themselves.
It's true they are very strict
Yes
My husbands family have always been very understanding.
I think I imagine that maybe
Did you get married by the Jewish or Catholics ?
No, we had a religious, an Jewish ceremony
Oh. How nice.  Yes.
Yes, and let's say then is what I'm saying, my son is going to be raised and I say it's important that he's raised with a religion.
None
He is already an adult, he will decided what he wants to do.
And what did they say.
True, if I want to go, or if he wants. I don't know, stop being, be another thing, but I do believe that whatever religion it is, a child must be raised with the defined religion
My youngest girl, the one that is bigger they got baptized and are Catholic, but the youngest, though she was baptized in the catholic church, she also visits the church
The Evangelical church.
Hm mm
Let's say that she doesn't have the opportunity to be bad.
Their religion of theirs. And she likes going with them, and I never told her no. When they asked me if they could take her, I said yes.
You know
I don't understand that, because my mom, when she says that, she goes to the church, she has to wear a skirt.
Then, I tell her, but why is it bad to wear pants
I think that the Bible says, that, pants, are worn my men
Yes, but to me that was one of the
It is related to that.
There are people who, when it comes to the Bible, take it as too strict. A little of what organized religion is.
Those are the ones who become fanatic
Yes
They interpret word for word what is written.
Words
The Iraqis, with their doctrine craziness, who kill people in the name of
The God they had, or what they believe.
None
Sometimes there are people with their minds, distorted
None
Interpreting things that should be unifying. Because religion must unify, no matter which one. Do you Understand?, I don't think that only because two humans are from different religions they
Must kill each other, because of that belief
Yes
For me, as a non fan of anything. I don't become a fan of anything. I was raised in the catholic religion
I helped at church. I belonged to the Mary's Daughter Club, I helped a lot at church
It has always been, my faith, the catholic church. I took my children to church and I baptized them, because that's how I was raised
As growing up, if they want to go somewhere you should understand that You can't stop them to go some church.
You can't believe in that, because the catholic church says it's different
None
Many evangelicals and Jehovah's witnesses try to come to your home and sell whatever they have to force things into your brain.
Sometimes they knock and I thank them and say: I have your book, and if they insist I say, I'm catholic and don't
There exist so many kind of people. I understand them
They are no prudent
Their work is well, not their work, but they want to transform people into their religion, but they don't respect
Yes
Right? It might be me, but
I had lady that came looking
You're in sin, what do i know, but I've been a sinner since i was born my dear. so let the lord punish me when i get up ther, so
When they attempt to say such negative things, instead of saying that you can know the lord better.
Everywhere, but that's about being a sinner. Yes, I keep sinning, and you're sinning right now talking like that
Hello
Good night. How are you? With Norma here from Atlanta Georgia. Where are you from.
I am Arthur, I am in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
Okay.
Where are you from, Norma?
I am Peruvian.
My roommate is Peruvian.
There are many Peruvians in this area.
From Lima right, also Mexicans
You are Mexican.
Yeah I am Mexican
Okay
From Mexico City
None
Very good and in Georgia what do you do, study or work?
I take care of my kid, I am a housewife.
Okay, very good, your husband is also from
My husband isn't Peruvian.
Peruvian American
Yes, my husband is American.
Very good
What do you think about religion?
I think that from the times of like medieval and that
None
Religion stopped being spiritual during industrialization
None
It became something more political. Lately, it has ceased to be so political and keeps bringing up the ones that are.
None
You can be very religious and spiritual
None
But not necessarily in favor of an institution and then maybe you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what is said by
Some certain institutions, like the Jewish one, the Catholic one, or the Muslim one. But then, maybe you can hear among the topics and mix a bit of the philosophies of all of them. Like
Use them to follow a good path of life
None
And what do you think?
I am very religious, I belong to The Hare Krishna Religion. I don't know if you have heard of it.
Ah, yes. I've never heard about it. I don't know very well what the Hare Krishna is about.
Yes.  It's based on a Hindu Philosophy
None
So firstly, we believe that you are a part, or a portion, of God. And we also believe in reincarnation. We have rules and regulations. We're vegetarian, we don't eat meat, eggs, or fish.
We don't drink alcohol.
And why not, why don't you eat meat, why do you think that?
Because for us, we believe that, every life animal deserves respect, we have to avoid violence.
Okay
So that's why we don't eat meat and we don't intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol.
None
We don't drink coffee or tea.
Yeah
We don't play around
No playing around games.
No, and are you religious? are you from any religion?
And no, I don't belong to any institution for the moment, I grew up catholic, but now I'm bigger I'm twenty one years old
Around eighteen i stopped following the institution because, i didn't have much interest in it
I felt in contact with my spirit.
None
I didn't have to go the institution to get that
To get an interest, and lets say practice life, but
None
I don't like the institutions
But you believe in God
Yes, definitively, but
That is nice when that happens!  Sometime you don't feel connected to a group of people.
Exactly
The important thing is to have God in your heart and develop your relationship with God.
Yes, precisely, knowing if it really is
In Utah I met my husband and now we are living in Idaho.
A girl?
Of course.
I study chemical engineering
To corrupt religion
Yes
I think it's the opposite. People who start studying scientific things are normally very religious, because
When they start knowing themselves or about things, they can explain.
None
More questions arrive and you understand that the world is not understandable, there are miracle things all over the place and time
I feel that each time, when people knows like scientist do, and those people understands that there must be a supreme chaos, and a divinity behind everything
Of course, a supreme being which controls everything.
Yes
The, religion is, well, religions or the beliefs have a supreme being. It helps people being closer. In catastrophes and times of pain, then you always
Atheists are always desperate
They don't ask. They turn their faces, like that, from asking God to help them.
Yes, that's it
It's not that, it's in their heart, right? You just feel that there really is a supreme being that many times doesn't.
Exactly, you don't turn to religion only to ask for help, but also to thank
Of course.
I think that many times, people become religious at certain times because they need help, but once they're ok, they forget.
In our philosophy, there's  a verse that says, not, when you're suffering.
Yes
One always asks god for help. and one should ask got to send more suffering because that way you remember him more.
When you're ok you forget about your relationship with god
Yes
When you do fine, you're very happy.
Yes, you don't remember?
You think you are in control of everything that happens and that one does the work, right?
Yes
God blesses and helps you in many circumstances.
Yes, true.
Do you have a notion about reincarnation? Have you heard or read about karma?
If you had bad Karma you would reincarnate in`
All
To improve it, not just clean it, no that you have another opportunity to do your karma something good, more pure it's not something like that
Yes. Okay, the karma law is the law of action and reaction. That, in response to his positive or negative activities, there is a reaction. It can be positive or negative.
Oh. Okay.
Why are there so many things that happen to good people
It's from the negative reactions of their past lives that they are suffering.
Yes
Its not that people are not innocent , its just a reaction with free will.
God doesn't force us to believe in him, doesn't force us to serve or do devotional service
Yes
We have our free will. And if we do negative activities, many times there is a reaction of the karma law. For that, nobody is free of the karma law. It's infallible.
Yes
No.
I see the hare krishna
Yes, in our religion.
And what do you do? Do you gather with the Hare Krishna every week, or every day?
I'm married now and live in the apartments by the temple.
OK
The temple is here in Georgia, in Atlanta. But before I lived in the temple, I mean, I was like an intern there. I lived like I was doing service not to Krishna, no. To God.
Yes
No there are many services we do, one is preaching, one is singing, and one is kitchen work
Does many different activities
None
The center of your life is god, and you offer him all your deeds and meals, and when you wake up in the morning you go to the alter and pray.
So now I'm married and I have kids so I have to take care of them
Sure
I always go to the temple and we are devout. Many people come on Sundays or in big celebrations that we have during the year.
None
Do you have something like a prophet, like Jesus Christ?
We have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada Ace Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada. He is a devout of God. He brought this knowledge to the WEst.
None
No, he's not. We don't really honor him.
What's his name again?
He respect Jesus Christ too
Yes, sure.
Sure, he brought that knowledge to the West, about this ideas of Krishna, as we call it, we name it after the city
Ah. Okay.
None
What is the name of that man, again?
None
What's his name?
Is called International Society for the Conscience of Krishna
Oh, okay. But what's the name of the man who brought you?
His name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
Where does he come from?
Yes, he was born in India.
Okay
He is no longer on the planet. He already died and abandoned his body.
It is very possible that he has reincarnated or won't reincarnate.
He is considered a pure devoted to God, he returned to the spiritual world.
So then he will no longer reincarnate
No, he will no longer reincarnate because he reached the goal of life in this world. This material world is where you develop your devotion to God.
Yeah
From the spiritual world, you can't can't come back to this material world to experience the cycle of birth, sickness and death that all of living things go through.
Yes, exactly
No, even the animals and humans being
Okay, of course
No
He has already passed that level and he no longer reincarnates
Yes.
Okay
Yes, he passed that level. He is already a pure devotee.
Oh, very interesting.
I don't know if it's very interesting, it would be great if you not interested could

Mhm.
If two or three people answer from the thousands, they already earned enough money for whatever
To cover the expenses right?
It is sad that
It is
With two or three fools they already molested all of us right?
I installed a spam filter to get back in control.
None
I asked for it. I did not buy it, but they installed it from
None
I believe that filters a little, but not always. It says junk appears ten or twelve a day, right?
If I read an article that looked interesting to me that Microsoft what wants to do is making software that does that
That one time I sent a message to the computer that it has to make something I do not know that has to break a code or do some task so it is not
Very, very large
None
If one is sending e mail, write one e mail and I will send it, no-one will not even notice.
So
When the computer does the task and break the code exactly in microsoft, it will send you a certificate to your email.
The person took a little time to make that. If one is only sending two emails it does not matter when the email will arrive, and will know that it is not spam.
None
One, the computer does not have the strength like this processor that can work a lot. Right?
None
Says this is to protect.
Slow, and they wouldn't be able to send all the e-mails that are being sent nowadays.
None
When someone receives an e mail that one knows is a spam, it can be thrown away.
It needs to bring a file, attachment, or something like this.
Yes. I don't know exactly.
You want to open this e mail ?
Know exactly what it is, but I think it's a good idea.
I say they made it because when I send by yahoo, I have one mail division.
None
In yahoo and sometimes when I`m going to send an e mail, it ask me one  to identify something that is decoded, needs to be decoded
None
I'm sick, so I'm not supposed to sit down, walk, or stand for long periods of time.
Yes
I send messages like this.
Yes.
So then, put the pieces together, the letters how they go
Yeah
But sometimes is a P, R, J
None
Tea and a number and something like that
And the numbers. Yes.
It is like a puzzle.
I had seen them
I don't know if that what is
Yes, I don't know.
Protect it from
But I think the filters were not too efficient because each time that you put like you can say
What is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam right but many times then
Yes
Who believe in the SPAM, they know which ones are the phrases that, in general, activate the filters. Right?
None
Then they believe the message is the form that no
That not filter
That won't pick up the filter, yes then
And how is in the forums, had you thought in the forums like the Univision or Telemundo
Once in a while
When you write a word like stupid.  we don't permit that type of vocabulary
Interesting.
Hello, how are you?
Audrey, hello. How are you?
I am Miguel Angel in Philadelphia, and you?
My name is Aodri and I'm in New York
You're in New York. Are you from Argentina? Don't tell me.
No, I'm Peruvian.
I'm Sorry! Because you had the chor you know, well I thought this one is Argentinean
You are not the first person
Ok
Tell me
What did you say your name is
Odri
Atri?
Aodri
Like odri
Yes, exactly.
That's very good
What do you think of unsolicited mail?
I think that unsolicited mail is a mess.
Yes
That I throw it in the trash
No, yes, I am
When it arrives
When I open my e-mail, sometimes I see a lot.
It makes my nerves
I want to see who wrote the nine messages, five of which are new.
Yes
They went directly to the trash
The email is a scandal, the spam
No, the service I use for the mail
Whaich one of these do you use? Google?
I use gmail.
Gmail yes
They and you can assign
None
That they like I don't know how they do it, but they have a way of verifying that like it is spam and they put it in another folder.
None
I say that ninety percent of the time it works very well
I have, Yahoo and it places the spam in a different folder.
Yes
Don't read it if you don't want to.
I think
That is true
I believe that most of of the services of the technical of mail have that now because is Is like an invasion because they try in any way to put
Words like it was a conversation,not only in English
Oh, no
I also receive too much in Spanish
Yes
My personal mail and my work mail also I receive too much
Yes. I also the Spanish. I have been living in Spain until the last week. I only have one year here in the United States
Spam is also the same in, Spain. Language doesn't matter, it is international.
Bad things get to anywhere in no time, huh?
You never have bought nothing from a spam
I've bought books in Amazon and I've bought tickets to concerts and all that kind of things but it has been always because of my own initiative.
I want to buy a book, some cd, some ticket for a concert or for movie.
But that's it because I wanted, never because I have received a spam and I have opened it and have bought because I don't read it directly you know I eraseit.
When I receive something in my mail that I have not asked for it. I send it to the trash directly. I don't even read it.
Have you bought something?
I read an article in the newspaper about a man that
None
He loves buying things
None
He lives off of that and I but, it seems to me, I have never met someone
Ok
We don't like spam.
They sell you things they take your money
They send you a low quality product.
I have met people who have bought and have said well this is shit, this is a thing that breaks in two days
Or it breaks or you know that then they are not quality things because if you say.
Yes
This is spam, everything is trash.
It is poor taste
It is like the sale of all those catalogues that there are of
Of really absurd things like that well one thing to scratch your back and that is a, and have you seen these catalogues of things, of stupid things
Have you seen those stupid things
You know something that
Yes.
Maybe if there is a reason to have it
Have you seen the booties that have a plug to heat your feet?
Yes.
The lady sell the things like him
The fee gets warmer and warmer for my mother when I start to buy.
Like I always say; someone has to be buying this from them, or they would not be able to do what they do.
Sure
And they put laws like that, in the state of Virginia is illegal
None
Dens a To dens a spma, an electronic mail not requested
Yes
But the same, a lot arrive, horrible ones arrive
Yes
When I see similar phone calls, that makes me crazy.
No, to the ones that call by phone, to those ones I directly say no
Yes
I am sorry, I am not interested, and that's it
I am not that sweet with them, take out my name immediately
I don't know if it is federal or for the state yes it was make by our Governor and that is from a cover
And you can put your name and if someone calls you they have to pay a penalty because it says they should not call
I have my former boss,the thing he used to do when they called from a, one of those cards, for a raffle in the house
From the mortgage he used to say wait a moment and he left them waiting, because he said look when I have to talk to customer service of anything, a credit card, the bank or I don't know
They always have me waiting for a long time.  I would love to tell them
Yes,
He left them there and he loved doing it.
You don't know what happens also to me I feel a little sorry. Don't laugh, but it is true
I feel a little sorry for people who have to work and make a living calling than treat a man, I am say I am not intersested and hang up.
But I try to be a little nice because people are working and making a salary calling, as telemarketers calling, it is not pleasant to them either.
That people mistreat and insult them. They hang up the phone without answering.  Because I have to try, I have worked, well all
When I was younger and I was a student
I worked as a telemarketer. In Summer you have well
None
I received calls, and didn't make calls,
Yes
I was working for a provider in Spain also for an insurance company
Yes,
Roadway assitance
Ok
I had to call the people, because they wanted to stay with their broken down car, when the tow truck came to take it to the shop.
I had that people call you with problems
It is not your fault at all, because I was the last monkey
I was just another guy in the company and they just paid me to
Answer calls and give a service the best I knew, that's why I feel a little bad for people who call you
The people that call have not intention of makeing you angry or annoying you.  They just want to eat like everyone else does.
You want to have a job?
Yes
I feel bad I am going to buy a product that they sell
At least treat them fine and tell them look I am not interested that is it, because the people, like they say do not have attiitude here in the US.
Yes
One of the cultural differences I notice in, Spain is called an edge.
Yes
You need to be edge because people get on top to the beard
You know when there is not a need to be on edge
You're right, not always is that way,but I will not lie when say no
Now
Because is the same thing, especially when they call my cell phone I say
Sure
In the middle of the day or sometimes at work, I know what and I look like I have a lot of things to do.
Yes
Nobody has them but I have the balls.
And count Odri that makes him a Peruvian with an Argentinian accent from New York.
You know this is a halfway big count that I'm good. My parents are gone but I was born here with Peruvian.
None
Good children of your country anyway.
None
Neither of my parents have Peruvian decent,nor does my grandma nor my grandfather
None
My grandfather lived in Argentina for a decade and
I understand
He was forced to take all of the Argentinian culture
That's what it is
Yes, but my mother has very little left
None
It is good that I have that very strongly.  But that is because I worked to study in Argentina.
I understand.
But anyway hit me if I'm wrong but I am not a legal professional
Hello?
Hello.
Greetings! My name is Jenny and I'm calling from New York.
My name is Anni, and I'm calling from Miami.
Hello
Hello.
Could I put you on hold for a minute? The phone is ringing on the other line. I would be back immediately.
Okay.
Okay.
I am counting.
Hello?
It doesn't matter.
Excuse me.  What are you calling about?
Music
You want to start.
Music. We spent the whole day listening to music. I have a little girl of twenty-three months.
Okay.
No, I don't let her watch TV, but I always have
None
Music stood that was her throwing a dish to the floor because we we trying to
Ok.
Sorry
No, it's ok, don't worry
We spent the whole day listening to music.
All
Classical, or for playing or whatever. And we listen to it in English and Spanish.
Ok.
So when her/his father is at home, we speak only in English
Um
When he's at work, we only speak in Spanish.
Yeah, ok. I understand.
And you?
I listen to every kind of music.
Right.
I don't have a favorite, i can listen to anything. Even music in another language.
Right.
I spend all day long listening to different music because it soothes
None
Even the wildest animal, I think it's like that. At time, I work from home.
S
I work in the court. When I'm not in the court, I'm at the house.
Yes
It's the best moment to turn on the radio. And hear something to calm you and to put you back
Yes.
I don't have kids but I worked in a day care for several years
None
That was the best when wanted to.
Yes
One class of eighteen kids of four years to calm down.
Yes.
Put some classical musi
Hmhm, we
And it seems to change, the entire feel of the room. Because, it affects the sound of the human animal, like they say
Well, we had a
So.
My daughter started to sleep entirely during the nights two months ago.
Okay.
But when she was seven, eight years we would take her from our bed,
Hmm.
To her crib. And I couldn't, you know, I had much difficulty in putting her to sleep, and finally I found out that yes I would put music, with a sound machine,
Yes
She sleeps well. And now we bought her an iPod
Okay
I have a month and a hundred or more CDs
None
Then, I can select whatever I want her to listen to. Normally, when we send her to sleep
None
We take what is called Songs of Cradle
Ya
I put some music on, and turned on the sound machine.
None
We put her in her cradle and start reading books to her. As soon as she hears reading, she's asleep in five minutes.
She knows the routine
Sleeping yes, and for that reason was that we bought the iPod.
None
Because even when we are in our car, she wants her songs and to have all those CDs in the car,
It is better bringing the iPod
And then, she is, too. In some ways she isn't, but sometimes she acts like a baby.
None
Then we bought the iPod with the money that she
None
She was, my high school sweet heart
Right
That she worked in, herself
So, more or less, it's like her vagrancy, with regards to what you did
Yes.
That's a good idea.
We did it, well part hers, and partly mine, because i have my music there too
It's not going to be her music only.
Yes.
It'snot like that
Probably ninety five percent hers.
Oh. Wow.
Because that's how we are in a place, because her little car too.
See comments
It has an earphone
Yes
But with that, and when we bought it, I thought, who's gonna put a Walkman or something? and that's what I'm doing now.
No, that's the best, it's the best because, I'm telling you the point of view of a person that was a teacher
Yes, me too.
The parents cultivate the kids' love of music. It's so much like teaching them to read.
It helps them with concentration, if one observes kids sometimes it, when they listen to piano music
With their little fingers as if they were playing piano. All of that helps,
Hmm mm
For the development. I forgot how to say development in Spanish.
I understood, don't worry yes.
The development of the child for e-, for yesterday, so you're working marvels. Because I always thought that. I say to my husband all the time. When we have kids,
There are certain things, that you may think are a bit crazy.
Yes.
You know that I want to give birth in a bath with water, with music. And he goes, Aha. You are half-crazy.
We are going to have a baby.
Yes
God willing, in a week
Wow
And that's what we're doing. We're going to the maternity center that we have here, and that's what we're going to do.
Yeah
The first one was a C-Section
None
No, and it wasn't because I wanted to. It was supposedly for an emergency.
Oh, OK, oops, sorry, it's the dog. Shh, quiet
But I think that. Okay
I'm sorry.
That's okay. So,
Uh huh.
We're going to do that. And with her, she doesn't watch any TV.
That's best
You know, and often times when we go to church and they teach her with the little Elmo dolls
None
Or whatever, she just looks at me like what's that. People look at me like, how does she not know who Elmo is, and I say, well we don't watch TV.
That's the best method to insure the success of the child.  That's the problem with my husband.
Well I tell him, because his mom was a little strange because she taught him, she let him to, he was always right in front of the TV.
Uh huh.
My mom and dad never bought a TV, and I didn't have one until I was thirteen years old. He finds it strange
That I was always ahead in school. In the school system I was always ahead, I finished college early, he was waiting on me. Everything I've done, I've done it quickly,
And easily, and I always tell him it was because I didn't have all the distractions. I didn't have a TV to take an hour or two
From my studies. You know, it was always focused. My mom and dad were poor, but yes, one of us wanted to play music, and my mom and dad would do what they could to take us to music lessons.
If we were interested in animals, we'd go to a museum
Yea.
On the weekends, there was always something educational. So you grow up little by little, I mean when you're a teenager,
You grow up and you see the difference. And from your friendships you know about all that, that they know about that.
Yes.
And you feel weird, but when you become more mature, I look back and say thank you! I always tell my mom and dad, thank you so much.
I can buy all the things I want, if I want an iPod I buy one. I have one
Yes.
If I want a Playstation? We have one here, but mostly it's just there picking up dust!
Yes
I'm not interested and my husband says, if you are not sitting down to play with that thing, I won't play with it either. We never use it.
Yes.
It's just there. I also see the benefit of not wasting my youth away.
Also, since we are having a baby, I was thinking that we shouldn't let her
None
Watch television, but I was looking for an educational show that I could let her watch but
There are many shows nowadays.
Yes, but I, still I couldn't.
There are not that many, channel 13 has two that have the approval of the school system.
Yes.
In New York
What happens is that I know won't have a problem to get her interested in it
None
And I'd rather- yes, I can try to- until she's around three or four years-old.
Hmhm.
That she continues with her love for books, and music, and all that, I much prefer, you know, that we continue with that. I don't know
No
When the baby arrives i feel that I'll have a little bit of time
The most I'll do, if I do it, will be half an hour a day, and it's going to be a program that I know that
Yes
You know it's educational.
I don't know you, but I trust that you will do a wonderful job, because of the way I hear you talking.
I saw it and said, yes, this is what I want to do!
I don't know, but
But
But, I know.  I am listening.  I realize that he us good.  You kow what you say is correct.  No, there is nothing
That I would do different, so to speak.
The biggest problem we have is that we dont watch much tv
Hm mm
If you come inside our house you'll think we watch a lot of TV because our have came with.
Came with those 52 televisions.
Okay
Last Christmas we bought a TiVO
Okay.
Then, we recorded hose old movies and or programs that we are interested but
Hm
We never see ABC, NBC
That's the best
It is the Discovery Channel
Yes, mhum.
But because of that reason, I don't want her to see telivision, my husband is watching television.
Yes
When he is in the house, she is awake. No, we don't turn it on.
Okay
That was one of the difficulties we still have a bit, that he understands that I don't want that she watch television.
But he does not understand, that if he is watching television, she is watching
Is giving her permission
None
The problem I have is I don't watch television. I am always in the room.
Hello.
Hello.
My name is Zula of Texas
My name is Manuel, I am from Chicago.
Hello, Manuel.
How are you?
Good, and you?
Good
You are a father again?
Excuse me?
You are a father again?
I am a father again.
There wasn't any problem.
No, everything was good.
Ah, how good.
I was holding my baby in hand five minutes ago.
None
Why did they take her to eat
And it is in the house or is it still in the hospital?
Yes, in the house.  No, the next day after it was born, we left the hospital
How goo.
Everything was good. No, we were only there after he was born. Twenty-four hours, and that was all.
Now, he awakes every two hours.
Yes.
None
Every two hours we must feed him.
None
Well they are nursing him.
None
He doesn't need formula.
WELL, NOT YOUR TURN TO AWAKE
It's okay. No. That. Nothing, one or two times he awakes but that is all only to be with them there
None
That's how it is
Speak with Jenny
Yes.
I also spoke with your brother but, I forgot his name.
Yes?
Because, he began to do it. To study as well. Because Jenny stopped participating.
How come you have told me nothing of it?
That is what he told me both times we spoke.
She spoke a little Spanish.
Hurray.
I sent a e mail to the person of the studio, and I asked what will happened
Yeah.
And, he told me to hang up quick, it will end the call, because it will not charge that call.
Okay.
He sent an e mail to everybody in the world, saying you can speak with someone
Do not talk to that person.
I also receive one e mail from them.
Yes
Then, it looks like, your brother told me that Jenny read that message then decided not to participate anymore.
Yes, I heard something about participating.   I did not say I was no longer participating.  It only told me that
That it was thinking it was for her.
Ah
None
I told your brother to tell you I sent that e-mail and did not send it for her, it was spoken by that other lady that did not speak Spanish, little words that knew to say in Spanish
None
None
I think she speaks Spanish well.
Yes, she speaks well
None
It is weird you get in the car with her, she drives a Van, a caravan
None
When I was in Nebraska with them I drove once and it was weird
None
I used it several days and took her cd case
None
Maybe she has music in Spanish.
None
You are not going to believe it, but she had 60 or 70 CDs.
None
All of them in Spanish and then I asked her Jenny why do you have music in spanish. Why don't you have music in english? And she said, no I like music in Spanish only I don't like music in english
None
Oh, I said, that's good.
None
She knows everything, I don't know how long she has been practicing Spanish or speaking spanish. she speaks very well.
How long has she been married to your brother? It sounds like your brothers children are grown up now.
The thing is that she had her kid from before.
Oh, she already had.
They're about four years old.
Right
Three or four years
Yeah.
Yeah, she has children from her previous marriage
Yes
Oh, they have only one daughter
None
From my brother's
I don't remember what we had to talk about, but your brother was telling me that he has had problems living there in Nebraska.
Since there aren't many hispanics, and he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no Hispanics, he's the only Hispanic
Yeah
And, I told him that if he had problems with people looking down on him, or talking to him, and he told me he hasn't, that he has only had problems once with
With the father of another of the kids that were competing in wrestling with his kids.
Oh, yes, one of them is a wrestler.
None
But, wherever you go you'll gonna find good and bad people.
Of course, yeah, it always happens.
Yes.
Well, he said no. In addition, he said he had many problems and he also got many invitations to attend Christmas parties.
I did notice that. I think that since this town doesn't have many Hispanics, in fact, there aren't any
None
In places where there are many Hispanics, people start to get along with bad people.
Sure,
Americans start looking down on us
None
Hey think we are all the same
Sure.
And since there are none here, they don't have
Prejudices against them, yes.
They don't say this one is Mexican, so he's not going to do that.
Yes
No, I believe they haven't met many Mexicans.
Yes.
And because of that, since there are no Mexicans there, they don't have problems.
None
When Mexicans have a party, they finish at one or two in the morning and they play the music at a very high volume, like that.
None
And over there, there isn't any of that. Until just now. In a bit more, Hispanics will start arriving
Yes, it's true. It happens.
Yeah
What music do you listen to?
Texan
Tejana, yes.
I lived there in Texas.
None
The entirety of the music
None
And even though, here barely, sometimes, I can not find records of that, I search but since it is barely heard here, it is not heard much,
None
Sometimes when my brothers come, I bring music from there.
And traditional music from Mexico, you don't like it?
I like the nortena
None
Yes, like the traditional, like mariachi and all of that, not much. Banda too.
What about regular music in Spanish?
Yes.
What, of any country, I don't know
I like to hear that?
None
I like to listen to Colombian.
Colombian.
Yes, music, there are lots...
Cumbia?
Many like very calm music
None
Not too loud
Okay.
Yes I play music in my car, I like to listen to it low.
None
That music can relax me at times.
It is good to listen to music in the car, more so if you are driving alone.
Yes
I am not one of those people that constantly listen to music, I have friends that listen to music constantly and now that people have those Mp3
Yes
Where they can have eighty, one hundred, or two hundred songs constantly. They have those in their ears, listening to music.
I do not like that much
Yes, not me, do not like, from time to time. Yes, like that, to relax or in the car, or if I go exercise, I also like to hear music.
Yes, There's people that can't sleep. My brother lives in Nebraska.
None
There was a time that he slept, and if there was no music he did not sleep.
None
And I told him to turn off the radio already.  But insisted that you can't sleep without music and never sleeps at ease.
Each one.
Yes, I like to wake with music.  My alarm clock is a music player.  When it alarms in the morning, I rather that sound.
Kills your heart.
Yes.
Is the music that we have here inside the music player. Then, it is good because it wakes you little by little.
Yes.
None
I don't know, dances or clubs? In Texas?
When you arrive here in Houston, you will go out often to dance salsa.
Yes.
Yes, I encountered a group of people there where I go to school, that dance salsa and go out often. But, now no. Now I don't have time to go out anywhere.
None
Became tired of going out because I had already gone to all those same places, and seen the same people
I want to dance, and if I could not dance, and almost could not dance, and the people stepped on you or strike you when they are circling. Then,I had already tired of that.
Yes.
Besides that, you have to pay a lot to get into those places.
That's right.
It is like ten, fifteen dollars to get into those places. So, not anymore. I now go out but I rather go to a quiet place.
None
Where do you you sit and talk?
We have a dance salon in here, Mexican groups come and play,
None
Northern music, and stuff like that.
None
You won't believe that it costs around fifty dollars to get in.
Why do they bring well-known groups?
Yes,Still, some people are not lucky enough to get tickets, some don't get in.
That's because you live in a very big city!
Yes.
So,
I went once and liked it.
None
But you can't even walk in there!
Yes and no. That's the problem,
They are good groups from Mexico. Everybody want to see them.
Of course
The ball has a capacity of 4000 people. I went once and didn't like it.
Yes
I don't go out that much because I have too many problems
Hello?
The call dropped
No, I'm here.
Good night!
Good night!
My name is Carmen, I am Puerto Rican, I am from Chicago, who is this?
Cristina, I am Chilean and I am here in Idaho.
Good Night!
How are you?
Good
You are there in Chicago?
It is a little cold and a little hot
None
None
And what time is it there?
None
What time it is there?
It is twenty to eleven.
Late.
There?
It is nine here.
Night time?
No.  Yes.
Wow!
I am right?
Wow,
Where did you say you were from?
I am from Puerto Rico
Puerto Rico
None
And How long have you been here?
I have been living in Chicago for the past thirty years
Long time
Yes, a lot. And you?
I have been living here for ten years, this year.
Wow
Not so long, yet, but it seems like a lot. Right?
Isn't it cold there?
It has started getting cold, but not as cold as Chicago
Chicago is very cold.
That is right.
Especially the snow
Oh, I heard that is terrible.
Right
My brother-in-law lives in Chicago, too.
In which part?
Yeah. I don't know, because I didn't see where they lived, but he goes to the University of Chicago.
Right.
I think they live near the University apartments.
Oh, okay.
So I don't know where
You know today's subject right?
The music
Right.
What Puerto Rico music do you like?
I like very much Bachata music
What is Bachata?
It's soft music.
Right.
When they sing that music, it's Alejandra and Alex. I have always taken CD's from the library.
Yeah
I also like Reggae, i don't know if you listen to Reggaeton, which is trending now.
Yes, I have heard something.
Of Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Tego Calderâ€”n, Ivy Queen
So, living in Chicago, did you struggle to maintain the music you listened to back in Puerto Rico?
No. Almost.
Because a lot
Almost the same
Because it isn't. There is a lot of variety here in Chicago.
Couching
You didn't miss that a lot?
No, because back then,
Oh, that's great!
Back in Puerto Rico I listened to the Boleros and Salsa, but I don't really like them because they aren't dance-able.
I see.
They're more romantic.
I see.
But we use the Merengue a lot.
None
That's like: Olga Taâ€“on, Elvis Crespo
Oh, yes
Here in Chicago they do a lot of Puerto Rican parades
Oh, so great.
They are invited. This year came Ivi Queen which is the the the the Babe of Reggeaton.
Elvis came in 2004.
What?
Crespo.
Really?
Yes
Nobody comes to Idaho.
No.
No.
In September we have a Boricua Party, Tego Calderon came. They always have many concerts in the parks.
That is so awesome.
They are free.  They have signs that say Long live Chicago.
None
And they take lots of music from Colombia, from mexico, from all parts of Puerto, of, of the world.
Then you don't feel as far from from where you come from
Aha
There is all that,
None
There is nothing here in Idaho. Here, the only music is more like Mexican music.
None
I don't know what it's called.
Right.
But it's music that i haven't heard over there in Chile either.
No
In Chile you listen to music more like boleros.
Right
You miss it here because you don't hear much of that. And no one comes here either.
True
Right
I missed it so much that I'm now listening to satellite radio.
Right.
And that's how I have been able to remember now many songs in spanish, because after like ten years, finally listening to songs that are playing now
That stuff like Reggaeton
Right
I had no idea about that because it's been ten years since I have listened to music in spanish
Because now here in Chicago we have a station that's, nine hundred three point one FM.
And it's music in Spanish
THAT PLAYS ALL DAY LONG
Oh sweet
Right, specially when you're driving in your car
None
You don't get bored put on the radio on high and the travels seem
Of course.
You don't get bored or fall asleep in the car
Of course.
Listening to music
Yes, it's good having music in Spanish because.
None
Because in English, it's good, but it's not the same.
No
It is not what we've been raised or anything like that.
None
It really makes a difference if I'm happy with listening to music in Spanish once again
None
In my mood and all of that
It's like that music I don't know if you're listening to the music that has when they are one waits for another person
I got the phone to speak that music I don't like because it is classic
Looking forward to see
When you go on an elevator
Of course
You have music for me
None
It should be changed because it is not beautiful music.  Please, put on Merengue or Bachata, or music
Of course.
Like Cumbias, Cumbias are beautiful
And more animated, right?
Aha
If you're waiting so long, at least you can dance?
Is it that you go to sleep waiting.
Yes
I was waiting for fifteen minutes to talk!
Seriously
I was waiting half an hour and when I went to communicate with someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven at night
They already hung up on calls
Seriously?
None
My
How many times have you talked?
Twice with this one.
Oh, yeah! I've already been with this
Yes
Is thirteen
Knows somebody in the university or they study in the university because
None
But then you can call and wait
They call you can call and after 5 in the afternoon, you can call to anyone, after five.
To anyone you like
You can talk more of once a day
No, just once.
Once a day.
Yes.
I talked to my sister
None
And my sister lives in Atlanta, Giorgia
None
And I speak with her. She is who in the recording for this show when you hear to the child saying what to do and all that stuff,
Oh
She has avery sweet voice that all the world love.
None
Then when she did the recording she said to me that calling for, we could hear her and speak with her, That was the only time that I speak, because from there I don't speak more
None
This is my frist time talking with someone else.
You are missing twenty three
Yes, I got my act together and that is why I called, because I was waiting for someone to call me. Nothing happened.
Because the last time, they put it for politics.
Yes
I called, and no one picked up the phone.
It's scary. Is it not?
But, you know, I receive calls each afternoon at 5 pm.
Okay
That if I want to pick up the phone to talk, but I do not pick up the phone because I do not know what they are talking about.
None
How is the music? This is the second time that I talk.
Sure
I have talked with many people from Nebrasca, Philadelphia, Miami.
I see
Yes
No, I like the music topic, it's easier. The other time it was about immigration. That is what I think.
Yes, I spoke too.
I do no like to talk about politics and migrations
None
I don't know what happened
I don't like politics but i talked about immigration, marriage and music.
Yes
About cell phones, I only have nine left to go.
And after twenty-something calls, you don't have to call anymore. Right?
After twenty five calls, you wait two or three months, they then send you a cheque home
That's good.
Yes
I'm going to start working
After five o'clock you can call anyone that appears on it
Of course.
Call after 5pm in-order to get a hold of someone.
The title of what they're talking about. The theme.
Is everyday different?
Last time, i talked about five times referencing marketing
Five consecutive days.
I talked for about an hour with two music, three with marriage, once with cellphones, there are lots of themes.
None
They didn't change, the themes have changed.
Sure
But first you had to talk a lot about the topics.  Almost always they were the same topics so people can talk.
Sure
Look then, ah
None
You. When you are driving, do you listen to music or not?
I listen to music on and off for many years.
Problems. Conversation programs
None
About politics
None
After a long time I get use to it and I forget to listen to music.  Then days pass by without listening to music.
Aha. Aha.
I realize the music really changes your mood.
None
Form for the rest of the day.
None
Now I started listening music to have better mood.
None
Because I don't know, it would be because of our Latin blood
Yeah.
One always needs.
Yes.
Need that. You know, that, the dancing music, that music
Yeah
Yes, because here I do not listen to much music like that of that style
Yeah
Right?
No, not merengue or salsa, not regueton, nothing? It's just regueton?
No. I like everything now.
Yeah,
I am in Chile and I like salsa and Merengue.
Yes
Now, the only thing I need to do is to learn it, that's all. But, I love it
No, but don't you watch them dancing on TV?
No they do not have any Latino merengue or anything like that here.
No
No, because there are very few Latinos here.
Yeah
Most ones here are unique. They are Mexicans.
None
But on TV, on the radio, there is nothing Spanish, nothing Latino.
No movies either?
On TV none.
No?
No, nothing.
Uh
We are in the middle of nowhere.
Bless you! Imagine that.
Yes, it's boring.
None
Boring. When I went to California to visit, I was to-
Betsy, hello, how are you?
One time yes, I am Tammy again, well and you, Oh my God
I'm seeing what you can tell me about social assistance or whatever, because I have no idea.
No. Yes, here, I think that some things are good but others are not.
Aha
Especially the one for older people they they don't give them enough money or or it is not because of the money but that they need medical help the pills are not completely covered
None
It is more difficult for them to take their pills because they have to think about  I have to pay  for the pills or I have to eat
Oh
Because they have to pay more and also there are people who abuse I know people who they are abusing
None
That other people really need
None
It is difficult as I have my wedge, my mother of my husband
Aha
She is on assistance. But they don't help much and she has to search for coupons
Should I buy a medication this month or next month?
That's ugly
He cannot have all of them because if you don't take things as you are supposed to take.
Np
You are scared because they will not help.
His is the welfare or pension or
Is this from mja or welfare?
That is it, I can imagine
Assistance that is given to them here isn't much, and it is hard to get, and you have to show that your need is real.
If you do what it takes to get it you have to be working
None
They do not pay you well. They pay you twenty dollars or a little more
None
Or, I think it iss less than twenty dollars from what the limit that they will give you deoes not help
Yeah
It is twenty dollars over the limit that they have but really that is not a lot
Yeah
Prefer that you do not work
I see
So that they are able to help you, but the help that they give you is not enough for you to be able to survive.
They don't pay you for all the medicine you need?
They are giving you something? No, they can't help you.
None
You can't survive without their help; although If you don't work enough they will not help. Also, if you work too much at once, they will not help.
What they help you with is not enough there is many ways anyway
It is hard and some people work under the table
Yeah
Because they can not say that they are working because then they will not help them and they have children
When your children have there eighteen years they will no longer help
That is why I was seeing my son my child that crazy comes to my home and tells me, Hey mom so why do you not want apply to the government for them to give me lunches
None
I say hey we make too much for them to give us lunches, I thing I give you to but lunches and I give you the paper
None
Four childern, wait four persons in the home to make about Twenty four thousand dollars
None
In a year that is not enough
Twenty four thousand dollars a year for four persons. No.
If I take the people with babies, there will be four.
None
Because I say it is a lie. I was showing my husband and I told him those people are crazy. Who is doing, I say where you work and live because here is where I live
None
My son moved to the apartment since seven hundred twenty five a month and that is cheap
MJA but does not include utilities
No that do not include nothing them you can imagine with two
Okay more expensive.
If a person has four people in the house and it has been twenty and four thousand he cannot.
It is not enough
Take care of your credit and save money
They don't spend it on things that they don't need
You recall now that I spoke with you yesterday
Yes, you already moved back
My son and his wife had a fight; therefore he will be moving back into my home.
Boy
My husband went over there and took all of his things .
Wow
It really happened
That girl must have done something very bad
The very bad that this man got like that wen he called me mom so and I tell him I support you so come over here I will convince him so he can go to the school because.
Yes and when he moved with the girlfriend he was not working
The people from work said that he can go to the school in the morning.
None
And to work after that so they will help him so I tell him well if you move here, if you go to school I will not charge you for rent
That it is good
But if you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because I want him to finish school
Of course
When I am with him, I babble. He does not want to finish school, and things will be difficult for him.
I would not send him to work at McDonald's forever
Mja, I know you will not help him if he needs it; because you are a man.
None
At his young age, he does not accept the fact that we are here and can help him finish his things.
None
I always give example of hard working people
He would like to have it, but the government will not help him.
He has the insurance in, Canada with him.
They put laws like that is illegal in the state of Virginia.
None
Bed and furniture, but we had welfare
None
My brother and I were in high school there for a few months while my parents were working a job.
From there because my parents were working they helped us because my brother was fifteen
None
I already had eighteen they did not help us for. for me, just for my brother but I got into high school and did not work until
I though that they would help you a little because they give you a card for medicine
None
He has to present it at the store where he will buy the medicine and and they will pay well that was the last time that I asked for assistance
But now I do not know how it will be. It should be more difficult
When my husband came from, he was in the air force.
None
Then, in 1992 we arrived here and he also did not pay that much.
None
When we arrived here it was insufficient to pay the rent as if we came into the program for a month.
None
Sufficiently to be helped and for the time it took for him to find work so he took a month
How great
He found a job within a month but the next paychack it took us a month and we came out one time from there but when one goes to the store one of them that they give you are like fake papers
Really?
When you go out shopping they give you a card
Oh
But the people give you mean looks
They look at you as if you were from another planet
They are giving you help and you can work. I could not work because where would I leave two children. I did not have anything to pay for someone to look my little ones.
Mja that is true.
I told my husband never again.
No
I do not put my family like that
No
You are asking for a little help
Like
Because things didn't turn out well but it is very difficult
They have had the same thing happen.  They give you a dirty look.  It is just like that.
People won't recall about that
None
When I see people that have in the need I say it can happen to anybody.
Of course
I say
Why look bad at people who get govermental help, it helps really, it's not a big thing
They are not stealig
Yes
They went because they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't want to do that
It was like a little paper that said that the government would help and the people knew
None
It's not money and they don't send you a check for your house or into your account
Well they send you a check
None
Well that was in ninety two is what I remember. They send you a check and then they send you a little book.
None
The monopoly money
None
It was twenty dollars and they didn't give you change
No
It's like you had to try to have the adequate because, I say, no, say it's that
The government would do it to make you ashamed
They had to be sure that you didn't use alcohol,that looks bad so now with the card it is better
Yes
Hello?
Hello?

HEADACHE
She's going to be fifty this November.
Well, she's travelled so many times on a plane
How nice no 18, boy
None
She gives a lot of work.
No, she's very good. She has her moments when she doesn't listen to what I tell her.
But
Yeah
When I ask her to do something, she does it because if she doesn't, I make sure she does.
Yeah
Because I want for her to behave good.
Yeah, that's good.
Therefore,
None
Sending too many emails at once will cause unacceptable amounts of internet delay.
You live with another person
Yes, with my husband
Another. Your husband, is that it?
None
That's it? Your husband and a girl. right?
Yes
The other one, that's coming?
No
Another girl, a girl coming, or boy coming?

Oh, you don't know
The only thing we want is for it to be healthy.
Is it hot in Miami today?
Today was not too hot, it was really nice, it was hot but cloudy. It was also very breezy. The temperature was still arou nd eighty eighty-five, eighty six here.
Oh, boy.
The humidity was not too high. It was a very hot day.
None
Because, what does not affect much here is only the temperature
Yeah
But the humidity. So then, we have, normally, I think about seventy, eighty percent of humidity.
None
You leave the house
Yeah
Just as you get out, you start to sweat. It is as if someone is hitting you with a wet blanket.
None
Is very sticky
Yes,
We are getting into the time of year we feel hot, but the humidity goes down.
None
You know, I can wash my hair,
Yeah,
My hair can stay wet for the whole night.
None
Because I'm not parched; there's a lot of humidity.
Oh, boy.
And, especially if I wash it in the morning and leave it in a, in a little bun
I got it
The hair I've left wet the whole day.
Yes
Always it's not the heat as much as the humidity, I believe.
Yes.
So, over there it's still cold, right?
It's cold, maybe sixty.
None
Yeah it's cold today.
And when you normally have snow
What?
When it begins to snow , and all that?
Maybe, the other day. It was eight no, seventy. The other day was seventy, but today, it's very cold. And every day is
It changed a lot. Maybe today is sixty, tomorrow fifty.
Then, when does it begin to snow?
I don't know.
Because, I thought that it snowed in New York.
Oh, in New York? Who?
Didn't you tell me that you live in New York?
Yes
OK

Go out to see my family, go visit them sometimes
Right
Two or three years without seeing them
None
You have an opportunity, of course. But I prefer to see my family. Taking walks, too. I don't know.
None
We are very united, we visit each other a lot
Yes
And that's good, you have times that is better to go out and see the family
Is difficult to go see your family and go on holidays and and more when you marry because you have to se your family and
Your wife's or husband's family
Oh, talking about, that is another issue.
Then their time is up, and the vacation and the money all goes there.
I'll tell you that I don't spend much when you go see family.
Yes
I don't know that you go on a trip to see different cities or countries.
None
There you spend more because you have spend on hotels and food.
Yes, of course.
Wherever you go, you are going to spend money.
None
I don't tell you to visit family.

That's great
Wherever I want to go, but yes I have been to Europe and I have been in Costa Rica and Guatemala I have been in Mexico but only in Mexico City.
In Puerto Vallarta and Chiapas.
Yes
I was in San Cristobal and Taxco when I was
Taxco
When I was in Mexico.
On vacation?
Yes I have a friend that loves to travel, but to stay long in other countries she just got back from being abroad two years in
In Taiwan. When I ran into her in Mexico, she was touring the whole country for six months.
I ran into her in Chiapas, so we went to San Cristobal, Guajaca, and Taxco
I returned, she stayed.
Yes, I have vacations.
Ah, from Mexico City. She was studying
None
She was like two years old
Mm, how nice.
Yes. Then, when I did ten trips with her, I hardly spent anything because we stayed at hostels, I don't remember what you call them.
You have to sleep in a room with a lot of people but we didn't pay anything
Two dollars, or three dollars, a night.
None
Almost everyone is a student and you have to share a room with people that you don't know.
Since you know the people in area, there is much less danger here.
No, yes, they are people that
These are
Who is doing the same as
People who are in the same
They come to travel like so, and they want to spend little money so they stay like so and then that was good but I also went to Europe and I stayed a month also in
Traveling to Europe but that ended up being expensive but my parents helped me because it was my present for graduating from the university so yes but after I was in Houston
I have only gone to Aruba which is in the north coast of Venezuela.
Okay.
Yes. and that is an island like Puerto Rico but I didn't like it, it is a famous tourist site in the Carribean but I didn't like it.
Puerto Rico is a lot greener because Puerto Rico is an island. Aruba is deserted island and there is nothing.
Absolutely nothing the only thing is that the beaches are beautiful but aside from the beaches there is nothing to see
It's deserted there?
In Aruba
Yes
It's very dry, flat and rocky
Beaches are also rocky
Yes
Yes, the sand is white and the water is very clear. You can also see beyond the water, it is very clear blue
Notice.
There is nothing else to see. Absolutely nothing else.
None
I am lucky that all my family is in Puerto Rico except my sister, who lives in Florida.
All the rest are in Puerto Rico but still, now, for example, I went to visit my sister in Florida and then in August
And then, I traveled to Puerto Rico to visit my family. And in December, I'm going to Canada to visit my boyfriend's family.
I don't have any time or money left
That's right.
I have made three trips. I have no money to go anywhere else. I think when I finish school, I'm going to take some.
Time off on holidays. Before I start again, I'm going to work to
To rest.
Yes, or to go to some place where I want to go. A different place, not just to visit family.
That's fine, because once you start working, you don't know how your life is going to turn out.  Your whole life is going to change, right?
Mhm. Yes, and usually when you start working, they don't let you take time off
None
I've heard of companies that tell you that you can't take time off during the first three months, you can't go on vacations, and some other companies say it's six months
You see.
How's your baby doing?
Very well, thank you.
Getting bigger
He's getting bigger, he was born on a Wednesday and we took her to the pediatrician on Saturday.
Aha. Aha. Aha.
And she had gained about a pound.
None
The doctor was telling us. i was there.we were talking to him for a while, he told us that it's very good that she gained weight because many children
After birth they tend to lose weight.
All
And, this girl didn't lose, on the contrary, she gained weight.
Right
She'll be two on November the 18th.
Right.
I hope she keeps like that, without having problems.
Right, at first they grow so fast
Yes
When children turn two they start growing fast!
Hi, Alex.
Betsy, yes you're talking to Alex again, how are you?
Fine thanks, you?
The subject of the trips
That's interesting.
Yes
Better that politics
I had a lot of different opinions
Yeah
Right. You want to start this time.
If you had money, I would like to go to Hawaii for at least two months
I say
What for ?
Because I never got there. The grandmother of my husband says that it's beautiful because she goes every now and then. I would like to go on a cruise.
Good Night!
Yes, he is.
Yes, a cruise would be fantastic.
I never got to go on a cruise before
Right, I traveled one time to Spain
None
And to Jibrartal and I liked it very much but the southern part of Spain where the beaches are
Yeah.
They were very pretty landscapes.
None
I didn't have the money to stay very long
None
It frustrated me.  Then I would win a prize and I would have money.
Yes
When one has money, one must have time.
Yeah
I would love to travel to Spain and visit the
Yeah
There are many castles and interesting things there
Yes.
Many things of the of the of the old world, many Roman things ah it's interesting, it's it's to know history
None
One needs money; it's an expensive country, especially for traveling
Uh huh
Yes and no it's not very dangerous where I am Columbia is very dangerous
None
One does not have fun there, even though it is a beautiful country.
None
One is always concerned about the security of the country.
Yeah
Spain is better
I would go to Israel if there wasn't so many wars.
Dangerous
If there was no war.
Yes
I would like to go there
Also, Colombia is a fantastic country, if there weren't what
Ya
You have great scenery.
I imagine so, yes
Yes. We have coast there, as well, but the problem is the war and the
None
The drug trafficking has totally damaged the country, and the image they have of me is horrible.
Yeah
You'd like to travel between the US or Canada?
In Canada, I would like to go to Montreal.
Yes, they have told me that it's nice but cold
Now where we live it's rain all winter, nothing more
Yes
Where we used to live before winter was a lot of snow and  super cold
Where do you live?
Near Vacouver
There is no snow?
No
Impossible
No, because we're near the sea.
You're very far North. Does it ever snow?
Well, sometimes there is, but the next day, it's gone.
Yes
And it doesn't freeze
Because here in Los Angeles there's never snow, maybe just in the mountains
Yes. It falls here, too.
Yes
I wouldn't know, maybe once every three months or something like that, it falls
But if it falls, it must fall because you're very far north, Betsy.
Yes
Yes, you're near Alaska.
It's not too far because, it's there next to the Pacific Ocean
Near Seattle, Washington
Yes.
Have you been to Seattle, Washington
Not really.
I'd like to go there.
Yea
Yes and also Washington, DC. Once I went to the capital
Mhm
I like history and everything that has to do with history, and Montreal, Canada has nice things like museums.
Two years ago
They say that Canada's really pretty
Yeah, if you like the winter and the snow.
There's not as much insecurity like there is here in the United States.
I haven't seen anything too bad
Here in the United States it's bad
Yeah, just think
It's almost like Latin America now
None
They criticize immigration here a lot because there is a lot of bad immigration.
I see
It has spoiled the country very much.
None
Through the years, I have seen that this ocuntry has really declined, and now in the United States there is abig difference between the rich and the poor.
None
I think in Canada there is more of a balance.
None
There is not much difference between a rich and a poor person in Canada, Like there is in the United States.
There is a lot of poor people here
There are more social programs over there.
Yes that is true
And there isn't that much people there, the problem here is that there is a lot of people
I see
Yes, the country has gone down unfortunately. Yes, there has been a lot
We already went to Florida two years-ago.
Yes and it's dangerous.
Yes
They can rob you, they can do something to you there is a lot of poverty as almost like a Latin country already I don't see much of a difference now
None
Latin countries are known for the difference between the rich and the poor.
I see it is true
The United States is becoming like that
None
Yes, but there are interesting things and one time I went to Texas and I liked the views
None
I have always liked the Colombian plains
Super hot
Super hot but very pretty
I see
The plains of Texas are similar, a little more developed
There is, I see
LOT OF BROILED MEAT WAS BOUGHT IN THOSE PLACES
I see.
It is interesting I would like to know Texas more
None
Through the plains above all, I love the plains the flats the kowboys I like them
The horses
The barbecues
I see.
I love barbecues. How do they say barbecues in Columbia?
Yes
You find that a lot in Texas
That's great.
I think is one of the most interesting parts of the United States and I would like to visit Seattle because of its cafes
Really? I didn't know that
Yes.
Well my parents are going to El Salvador in November for two months.
There are volcanoes over there
Yes
Yes I remember and the scenery must be beautiful over there
Yes there is but then again there's poor people and
There is security
No.  There are nto many jobs.
Yes, that's the problem with all the Latin countries that have never been able to get ahead
Yes is true
Yes, I hope they can do it one day.
Yes someday
Yes, I've heard the scenery there is very pretty because there's a lot of volcanoes.
Yes there are.
How are the mountains and the Salvardor beaches?
There is one that is called libertad, and there is another that there is a lot of swimming pools and sea waves are very big
Big waves?
Hi, there.
Because there is pacific and also the Atlantic, if
I thought it was just in the Pacific
How many seas have? Only Pacific
Like here
Yes
Because Florida in the Atlantic.
Yes
None
Because Colombia has the Atlantic and the Pacific, Colombia has two seas
None
It is a very nice country, I tell you of Colombia because beauty trumps many countries
I can imagine.
The country is the worst but in beauty has much
OK
Just as it has many queen models
The queen models.
There are many bad things
It's true
Yes, there are many things, I did not deny it, you cannot deny the truth
Yeah
There are bad things out of those situations
I can imagine
And not only that, there is insecurities and
None
When you do tourism, you do not want to go to a place where something bad could happen
Yes, it is true.
You want to travel to a place where there is not much insecurities.
None
One thing that will scare you
What is that?
I was never mugged in Colombia.
None
And I told you in Spain, I was once robbed in Spain
Really?
Yes madam, must be
How weird
I got robbed to, at a subway train
None
They took my wallet
No
And they stole a hundred dollars
And that was in Spain.
In spain
In Spain, not Colombia
Colombia it's so famous for those things
I see
Nothing was stole from me because that was one of the reasons that I always take good precautions
None
And in Spain, when you are taking precautions.
That's true
Yes, and you know something there was a terrorist attack in there too
In Spain?
Some trains were blown-up, they set up bombs due to Arab terroism
In Spain, really?
Many people in Spain die at train stations.
Oh, I see.
I used to be in those places where the attacks took place, a few years ago.
And that happened recently?
About a year ago
None
Yes, if something bad is going to happen to you
None
It will happen no matter where you are
That's true, I see, mhm.
Goodnight
Good evening, where are you from?
I am from Colorado, USA.
From Colorado. And originally?
From Puerto Rico
I am in Idaho and I am from Chile.
From Chile? How great! How long have you been there?
I have been in United States for the past ten years
Ten years. And how do you like it? Do you miss your homeland a lot?
Yes, a lot. It is like Colorado. Colorado has a lot of snow.
And does it change often? this season changes of
Of course.
Did you go from cold to hot or from hot to cold?
Of course, Puerto Rico is not like that. Right?
Today Puerto Rico is the same weather every year, but there your, to rainy moment and it's very sunny moments throughout the year like,
July can be very sunny and May very rainy.
But no snow
Oh, never. No.
How long have you been there?
I have been here for twenty years
A lot. since we talk about travelling, have you travelled to Puerto Rico?
Since my parents died in 1993, I haven't traveled to Puerto Rico. I've been to Mexico and other places though.
And I have gone to other plaes in the United States, including Florida, which is a
Yes
One of my favorite places.
Have you always lived in Colorado? Have you traveled?
And vacations to other states. Here, there is a lot to see. I don't know if you've had the opportunity to see other places here in the United States.
But there are many very beautiful places
Just Utah, and, I went to Washington.
Washington state  is very beautiful there
To Washington, of course, but not to the East of course, some day I hope to be able to, no.
How did you come to stay in Idaho?
To study
None
We came here after I graduated from high school, to attend University here.
Yes
Wow, then I'll call you cause I thought you were calling me.
How great.
We have only gone back to Chile once five years ago.
And
We hope to go back now, you know, this coming year perhaps.
And it's very hard to travel from here to there, because of things like passports and other things like that.
Oh, not so much. But it's more expensive than Idaho. I think that if we were in Florida, or California... Colorado is by the North, right?
Sure it is in the center and we are down below
Then down below, but around the center
Yes,it's centrally located for flights ,from here they travel to south America.
Then it is easier to fly
Yes for example if I said that I would spend some vacations in Cancun
Right
Went there for three days with around three hundred fifty dollars
Really.
It includes hotel and flight
That's why we don't go anywhere. Anything that costs more than three hundred dollars is very expensive
You should probably go to the State of Washington or a more centrally located place.
And have you traveled outside America, like to Europe or something like that, or you have not had the chance
No, IÂ´d love to go to Europe.
Yes
They have been to Europe and told me Paris and Spain are so beautiful.
What country would you live to travel to if you could?
One of my favourite countries is Australia.
And, in Australia
Yes and Australia would be fascinating for me because very exciting there and also New Zealand. But I would also like to visit Italy, Spain, France; but I think Australia is still number one.
I think it would be Italy.
Yes, Italy is beautiful
Yes, I think Italy. But Australia is huge, there is so much to do there.
I have worked for a company where the president of the company was Australian, and he was the CEO of the company, so there we made great friendship.
He would always invite me to go there, but I have a daughter of five years, I am a divorced father
None
And have decided custody.
Of course.
So,
You will stay
I would never abandon or leave her.
Yes, at least five or more years.
When she forget has a father and starts to think in boyfriends
She doesn't want anything to do with you, for a short time
I am crazy for her and she is Crazy for me
Of course, right now is difficult.
We have a great time.
We have small children, too, and that makes it very complicated to travel somewhere
I want to go to Puerto Rico next year, her mom is Mexican so she knows her Puerto Rican
Of course
Then i want her to meet that and she's crazy for going there and meeting her grandma. Grandma comes here every year and they do great with each other. There's great chemistry
You better know her age if you are going to take her there.
She
None
Travelled more than me in the last three years because she goes to mexico, with her mother, at least two times a year
Look, she's constantly
She's well used to travelling, she's really calm, the first time we travelled to Wichita
None
We went on one of those Greyhound and it was an awful experience, because she was very little still, and when she went on the truck.
Of course
She shaved her legs, put on pants and dresses,
I can imag
She had a very bad nightmare, and people there was really uncomfortable
Of course
And it was awful that travel, but
How old was she?
She was asleep, but when she totally woke up she panicked
She didn't understand yet
I promised her that I was never going to take her in one of those buses there, we call them buses.
None
The next time we went on a plane, a little plane and, we had a great time and she was very happy. And, not to mention it was only,
One hour of travel, compared to thirteen when we took the bus
That is so.
Yes
No, but it's great that people like traveling because, that way she is going to want to travel, because there are people who really do not like traveling and cannot believe that
It was horrible
Who don't like to travel
I would love to see the whole plane if I could.
Of course.
I would love to travel
People who have children have to be responsible.
Yes. Exactly.
Put your feet on the ground for a while
Yes exactly. If you have the opportunity to go other places, come to, Colorado; because it's very beautiful.
I have heard it's really slow.
You come here. It is beautiful
Many woods, no.
It has many national forests, they have majestic mountains, they have attraction points also in the city, they have many things, they have a little bit of everything. But you go here in the mountains, and you go to places that are fabulous, the beauty as is you were in a paradise.
How long have you lived in, Colorado?
I've been living here twenty-six years.
Wow
It'll be twenty-six in December
None
I came here with my first ex-wife.
None
We were married like ten years and went our seperate way
Oh, and she was American or where was she from?
She was half Puerto Rican and half Swiss.
None
She was studying, she took the classes as independent studies so while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling in Mexico.
Yes
We got along well, ended fine and realized we had different goals.
One changes a lot
Change a lot, yes.
In those years.
My daughters mother. It was a super short marriage.
Sure.
It didn't even last two years.
She is from Mexico.
She is from Oaxaca Mexico.
Yeah
But we have a good father relation with the girl we work very well in fact today we went to her Kindergarden School
None
The teacher gave a good report on the girl
She goes with my cousin's husband and wears her long skirt.
How rare is it to be rich?
She is hungry to learn
Now where does she live?
My ex husband
Yeah, with the girl.
She is my sister
You can see her often
I see her three times a week every week.
Look how father.
We shared together with her.
Look how good
That is good
If you are from Puerto Rico it does not cost you to come in and out of United States
Absolutely
I have never understood what is United States stand with Puerto Rico, because it is not a state it is a separate Country
It was invaded by Americans in 1898
Yeah
They took away from the Spanish from there they established American governors and from there they dominated until they started to gover-have Puerto Rican governors,
Like in Nineteen fifty four they have Puerto Ricans citizenship.
It has not been that long
But Puerto Rico, not that long, for example, when my parents were born were not citizens but I have been a citizen my entire life.
Sure
From then forward they started free commerce which is a free association with United States but without being a state.
Over there they vote on the primary for the president from here but they do not vote in the president elections.
Then in some way it is Independent, in some way has lots.
None
Union with United States would be very difficult because Puerto Rico would beecame a totally independent Country
Independent.
They would have to approve first but they have never approved
Good evening Mildred of Connecticut
Hello.  How are you?  What is your name?
Mildred.
Mildred, I'm Arturo.
Where are you from Arturo?
I'm from Mexico but right now I'm in Philadelphia
Okay, and we talked, or not.
Maybe that's it
Forgive me
I don't think I did. Where are you from? Puerto Rico
Yes
If you talk
Puerto Rican
All I remember now is the movie.  I do not remember anything that you are talking about.
Today is the music
Yes it is very good music, right,
Do you like it?
A lot harder
None
You touch an instrument or
What type of music do you listen to?
I like all music, jazz, classical music, contemporary music, alternative and fusion music.
It's like a merger of jazz with funk
Rock and all that.
A break. Ah.
Reaggeton and all that
Do you like Reggaeton?
None
Do you like Reggaeton?
I listen to everything: Reggae, Rap etc
Yes, definitely
Rock, I don't really like it but I listen to it. I can't listen for a long time.
I'm not a Rocker.
I do like rock.
I do like Bachata, Merengue, Salsa, everything, classical music
Yes
Romantic music lets you know a bit about other cultures and people from other countries
Yes
And
Lately I think that is being forgotten, nowadays, music is mainstream, like Hip-Hop, now everyone is making the same music
In the United States, and Mexico, they are copying it, it's become like a global gender.
I don't like it but it is impressive that everybody is listening to hip-hop.
In the music, I think it's like Reggae ton, it's becoming popular
Aha
Mexican music uses lots of hip-hop, and there are many rock bands that use hip-hop.
I think that it is helping bring people together, even if they ae from many diffrent nations. Mexican people like salsa, some others that are.
Yes
Different countries like salsa too, merengue, bachata and when you go to dances, well
Yes
There
Yes, I do enjoy dancing to merengue and salsa music, too.
Are people from different countries dancing?
Yes
I like it, I like Mexican music because it has a good rhythm, I like Ranchera music, I love it
Yes, Rancheras
I like them a lot.
It is interesting to get to know music from other countries. I like them but sometimes I don't know the tunes.
Have you ever listened to Arab or Turkish music?
Yes
Interestingly, it's good too.
Yes, very beautiful, and the chinese music also
Yes
Yes, especially o if someone knew how to interpret, well it would be more beautiful because they always present like a history when they do presentations, of them with the women that are moving their hands
Yes, and those fans
Yes.
They use it in order to tell a story.
They tell something with music, the music has no lyrics so they are painting an image.
Having lyrics creates a musical scenery or story, like the Mexican music, The Corridos.
They are very well known because they tell stories of different people and things that have happened, but they are very singular stories that are very good sometimes
We are brought to old times, with the natives doing their
Yes
Their dances and everything, and the slaves were the first that used music in order to complain, in order to be able to say
Yes
They were treated evilly. They were expressing all of their
None
They're discontent.
Yes
I believe that music will always continue for centuries
Clearly
Even though its different it will always unite the people because wherever you go, you hear reggaeton and already you know who it was, and sometimes
Yes, already.
I don't know if you remember that Japanese band; The Band of Light.
I see
That they began to play salsa
No
Yes. They were Japanese and spent a lot of time here. I didn't know that they would last, but they played a lot in New York. They did not have discos when they originally played.
The same salsa discos that they did in Japanese music
Japanese
Or they would be safe. So that if a Japanese person came here, to America, they would say, well, he is dancing.
No I've never heard them
They can say it although they don't understand
I see
I already think that it's pretty and relaxing music
Yes me too
One of its uses is to relax.
It's very relaxing for distractions.
I have discos while going out in Puerto Rico
None
Its one to relax to
Yes
When you want to be quiet at home, you can light those scented candles and relax. That helps a lot.
Yes, such as pure ambient sounds, or sounds that are
OK and you need music, you need music because if we had music people would be
Even a little more aggressive
It is that music
Because music calms you down.
Music can be very important.
There is a singer whose music is called Afro bit, his name is Cela Kuti and he for the civil war of Nigeria
He was very important because him with all his music, he made revolutionary movements, I mean people didn't see him as a musician but rather as a political leader.
None
Through the music he moved people. When he released new albums
None
The military was infuriated. And sometimes, he had the entire community practicing with him, all of whom had the same political philosophy.
And all of them lived together in communities and when he released an album called Zombie that critizied the army, because they were like a puppet of the government that was
Killing people of their own race.
None
He said everything in his song and the military heard it and
Yes, almost always, how do you say it? They extradite him from the country, they vote them
Yes, they threw him away, they jailed him and beat him and burned his whole house and all the
Yes, because they called it protest music. True.
Exactly. The music
In Puerto Rico they had topo, and who else sang that kind of protest music? Juan Manuel sang protest songs and sometimes made concerts.
Yes of course
Like they sang the truth about villages
Yes that it
Against the government, and all that, they are
People that make a riot out of everything, and the government doesn't like that.
They try to make people not go to those kinds of things.
Yes
But its interesting because they make history.
Yes of course, it gets involved in history as well, music will always reflect what other people are living in the moment, and what they think.
I think that same thing
Yeah, that's good
They need music.
Yeah. Always.
They tell love stories, disgraces, people problem.
Yes
Daily life has many uses.
Yes, everything. I think it's necessary that we need air to live.
I love music that when I put it on, I clean the house faster.
If you don't play music, you dont play an intrusment
No. I mean, I've always liked the piano, and my daughters like piano classes. I never had the opportunity of my mom paying for piano classes for me.
Yeah
I like playing the guitar and the violin.
The violin
The violin is an instrument that I don't know so much about, but it has precise music.
Not that much, I had a friend at school, that knew how to play the violin really good.
Yeah the violin is good, you know what I like as well, accordion music, I live it as well.
Like you said Mexican music uses a lot of accordions
In Puerto rico people we call it 'gicaro' of land, when they go out for Christmas
Yeah
You don't play an instrument.
And I play the guitar, bass, and i try playing the piano, but its too hard, i cant
So I just left it there
My boyfriend used to play bass, but he's older now
None
But
Yeah
He played with bands and groups. He played the bass.
I think it's always good to play music.
None
Also that serves on to let it off one's chest when I want to get distracted or something since I take my bass and I play a little
I see it relaxes you
It distracts me if it relaxes me.
I see that is good
Yes
That is good. Here we have a lot.
None
He does -DJ-
None
There's a DJ and music around the whole house!
Okay
And, all the time on the internet recording records.  And,
Yes
And we make records for people if they want
None
Sometimes we have done parties and we do is that he records a cd full of songs and we give it to the person as a gift
Yes
None
My uncle does something very similar to my father.
None
Now he did not have so much work; he is with other jobs but he also records.
Good evening. I'm Joe.
Good evening, Cristina, from Idaho
How are you Cristina?
Good, where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but I live here in Denver, Colorado.
How many years?
I've been here like twenty-six years.
None
Yes, and you?
I've spent ten years in
Where are you from?
From Chile.
Haven't I talked to you on other nights?
I think your voice sounds familiar.
Yes, I think so. You have your family, your husband, your children
Yes, you have a little girl right?
Yes, a five-year-old girl.
Yes, I remember. How is your daughter?
Good, growing, becoming very pretty, and sweet
You and the boyt need to be careful.
Right so, really that small she tells me that when, asks me that when she can have a boyfriend. I say, allot of time will pass until that can happen
Twenty five years
Yes, more or less. Could be
Yes
What, speaking of tonight's topic
Yes, how's there, how is where do you live ? It's a big city, in the city, or live outside?
Right. Denver is a city. Pretty big, but then, nos-
None
I live in Aurora, that is neaby Denver
None
It's a pretty big city too, but it doesn't have tall buildings like Denver.
And a little more quiet.
I wouldn't say that it is quieter. I would say
None
The reason being, it is a mixture of all.
None
Good people, bad ones, every ethnic group, you have, high crimes around too, and you seem to live a little fear
None
I live in an apartment. , i found some nasty situations around here
Yes?
Including gun shots and the like.
What kind of place would you like living in?
If I could go, I would go to a calmer place, a small village, rather than a city.
None
I am tired of the city. I drive here every day and the traffic in Denver is horrible.
Yeah
Too many cars, and where my girl goes, school, it takes me a long time, and I'm sometimes waiting for about an hour and half just driving, before going to work.
Wow
When you arrive to work you are stressed.
A little more relaxted.
With a big headache, yes
That's a big difference because it's calm here.
Yes
Really calm
What? Is it a village?
In general Idaho is mainly land, I would say.
Yes
I man the biggest city boyce
Yes, over there
It is a small and relaxed city.
Yes
I consider Idaho like a big town.
Yes
Because it's not a city and there are no big buildings
Yes
So there is, it's like what is here, it's a big town. But
How is the crime, and things like that?
Here people live, leave the doors open, the cars unlocked,
How cool.
And
That doesn't happen here in Aurora
Of course.  It is very peaceful.  No dad.  the daily news only told of someone who had lost something.  No.  Nothing happens if
If something did happen it would be the news of the
They're not about crimes, nor any of that.
Of the month
Wow, what most delicious thing.
Sometimes too quiet
Well I'm going over there then, to be your neighbors.
Yes, it's super peaceful. And people, a lot of people live in the countryside. So they live it's super peaceful.
It's all the opposite of Denver
Yes
And Aurora.
As i tell you, it is too quiet. There is not much to do, I mean here the people who live here they like things outdoors, like
Yes
Camping, and fishing, and going to the mountains to ski, and
People in Colorado too. we like going to the mountains a lot, camping
Of course
Well there are people everywhere, and
Of course.
These people who have come from these places, they have brought many bad habits too.
Of course
Things happen that make you live in fear.
Of course
With my daughter I am always in fear, because there is a lot of talk on the news of what happens a crime in Aurora
Of course.
That they stole this, that they ran over a kid, and the driver of the car is on the flight.
Of course
Things like that.
Like city then
Sorry?
When I used to live in Chile, I lived in Santiago for a while, it's the capital.
Yes
And sure, it's different to live in a city. I mean, you can't leave your doors open. You can't trust no one, usually. And
The cars, you can't leave your car, the Cs.
Sure
They break the car windows to steal them.
Everything
The CDs, and
That doesn't happen to everyone
I never leave anything flashy in the car.
It's quite safe in here. For me, it's too quiet for me, but, it's okay because I have kids now so it's a good place to raise kids
I dream of a place like that. The only problem is
That's why
I have a divorced father. I have a daughter.
Sure
My ex-wife and I share custody
You have to be close to
Yes, I would never leave my girl behind. I want to stay near her until she's grown.
Sure
And one day she'll get married and forget about me! I hope not, but I know that's what happens most of the time.
It happens a lot
Yes
But nothing, I would like to live in a more quiet place. My brother lives in Kansas
None
And it is also very quiet there.
No
They have festivals. People are more quiet.
A little tired, yes. But, God willing, in two or three weeks, when I have the baby, I am going to feel better.
This area has many beautiful things to see.
Of course
There are cities in Colorado that are growing since there are more people moving.
Of course
That also has its problems
Yes, and that is what I miss. Because here there is a lot to do. Besides the things you do outdoors, there is no opera here, there is not, places to
The mall is very small, there are no places to visit or or ballet or concerts and things like that. Those things are not around here.
City that are in Utah
Yes
And if you like to do things like that, go to concert or go to see you know an opera, theatre, or a show
You have to drive three hours to see the university and some tiny shows.
You miss that from the city, no, that
Yes
That you can find that type of fun stuff, but at the same time, there is
Here you have the opposite.
When we lived in Utah it was tranquil
Yes
In the city you have all that you want
Yes
And it's quiet
You have lots of relaxing parts. And it has lots of family attractions.
Right
I work in a high-tech company area
None
You have an amphitheater too one block from my work, and sometimes we hear the concerts while working
Right
From the building
I would like to live near things like that, that have activities and stuff
Yes and no, here you don't miss that, the activities. The only thing is, particularly in the city I live, you have lots of crimes. I would like
You have parts of border areas that are fairly quiet.
None
With good neighbors. Even though there are a lot of people, they care for each other pretty well. And like you say, they leave their cars open without fear of robbery, and other things like that.
Of course
In this, it is a mixture of good and bad.
Of course.
Understand, and the bad ones are the ones who like to take advantage.
Of course
You live well in fear, and, calm
Of course.
But traffic is horrible, let me tell you.
I don't really miss
It is it is really horrible. Because sometimes taxi drivers and on winter days it is still worse. Because when there start to be all these accidents and you cannot move on the highway
Snow and ice and all that.
It is terrible.
That is not at all strange
Someday it would be a dream to live somewhere quite.
She lives very close too
I like in Aurora, Colorady and she lives about three miles from me which is close.
None
In my old home, now my ex-wife's, they came in through the
Because the house has three levels
None
And the basement, its like isn't an basement. What did it stay up the windows
OK
They went through the back and stole a lot of things from the basement.
Weren't they in the house?
No, she had been gone with some coworker. I went to the house and inspected, and gave her my recomendations that she will have to lock this and that because
It doesn't let it exposed to the thiefs right
Sure
Where she is parking is not a very good place. They have get in her car about three times.
That makes me angry.
They have broken her window, taken her cds and stereo three times
That makes me angry
That's the bad thing of live in the city.you have any kind of atracctions
Sure. You have to.
Disadvantages
You have to be careful
I missed
Sure, here you relax, and that's the problem, because there are somebody who comes from other place that take advantage of the circunstances. The people trust too much
Exactly
They relax.
You have
And
Sorry, continue
For example, when that happened, the news here was that this man came and killed his family, and he took away two kids.
I remember that
Yes, because precisely, they are living here in the field and the children, you never know that somebody like that can come over here
Yes
And
Yes, crime could happen anywhere
Sure
It is sad.
You have to always be careful.
Don't be so trusting with certain people, strangers specially
Sure.
I always teach my daughter to not trust strangers and be very careful
When you have kids, then you start to worry.
You start to teach them; they do't have to knock here or there.
When you have kids, you  can take care of yourself
Yes
When you daughters, not any more
Hello, good afternoon.
Hello? Good afternoon. What?
Maira habla.
Maira, how are you? This is Jose.
Yes and no it's not very dangerous where I am Columbia is very dangerous
Hello?
Who are you?
Jose.
Ah. Again?
Again?
How are you?
Good and you?
How is everything going? How are classes?
Well, good. Studying here a little bit, and they called me and I say, well, why not? Why not rest a little bit, right?
Good.
How are you? And How are your classes?
Everything's going good, with this, I just got done with all the exams and well you see that I'm in that week where at least, you can can't really do anything.
Yes
I'd say I haven't gotten used to the weather outside yet. It gets me down.
Oh, no.
I swear, in the morning I turn the window and get angry. Ay, not again.
No, but, where are you from? or where do you live?
I'm in the high-rises, yes
Before coming here?
Yes, where?
Before coming here to study?
I lived, before coming here, I lived in Singapore for 2 years. And before that it was Ciudad de Mexico, all my life.
Then that's it.
Yes
It's very hot. It's hotter here.
Yes. I'm getting used to the tropics.
It's very hot in Singapore, right?
It's tropical, nothing else
Yes
Yes. I came and it was today. What's going on?
Then here, it's cold and
Yes
None
And in the air, it rains for a week. I don't understand how they can survive during this time.
No. There's cold, and there's no sunlight. After the summer, it feels nice. But a week like that, a little cold
I like that but it is only the beginning right?
Yes
That is what I don't like, but
Yes. If you can stand the cold until December, until Christmas is gone, after that it
When you return Christmas is over and it's not cold
None
The cold is worse when you return for Christmas because that is when it hits.
None
Yes, please.
Yes, I know my brother studies at Cornell which is farther north; about six hours from Philadelphia, but is
Much further north.
Yes
Classes don't start until the 28th of January because it is so cold.
Really?
Yes, he says that it is so cold that it is better to spend more days in May than to spend the days in January, right? The students, because...
Wow.
Fifteen years? Wow.
It can not be
And my brother.
And I was thinking about going there. Good that I didn't go, I swear that I wouldn't survive.
My brother was lucky enough to get a town house
Yeah
They had a big house! There is a little living room and kitchen when you go in and there are rooms upstairs.
It was pretty big. But the problem is, they were some of the university's new dormitories.
None
They had built it in the university's outskirts so it was pretty far from the university.  And his classes
Were engineering classes that were held at the other side of the university?
Poor guy.
There's a bus system there.
Public transportation there, why don't you use it? No, I don't want to pay the fifty dollars
None
He spent the whole semester walking.  During winter, in twenty degree weather, he walked forty minutes to get to class.
Ouch my brother
Poor guy
No, it's
He brought it upon himself
He's just cheap, right? He didn't want to pay the fifty dollars, so I said, that's ridiculous.
No, because the bus only stops four times every hour. So, he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes.
None
I mean, my brother, I don't know
What grade is your brother in?
Now he is in the eighth grade
Okay.
Yes, but
That's fine.
And what do you think about the crime wave here in Philadelphia?
About what, the crime wave?
Oh.  The crime wave, yes.
I have not heard much about it here in Philly
None
But I think that I have always been lucky because I have been walking at night alone on forty first and going to the store
THE FRUIT SHOPS ON FOURTY EIGHT I GO THERE AND NOTHING HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME
You walk to forty eighth?
Yes, additionally by myself, as happy as ever with my life, besides I don't even think about it, not even paying attention, I don't walk around in fear or anything like that
None
And nothing has ever happened to me I have no reason to, be scared of anything, to the contrary,once I get there they are all super friendly.
I don't know but I think that
Yes
I think I'm lucky because it's the same in Mexico. In other words, all my friends in Mexico have a story about being robbed, kidnapped or something that they have had done to them
And nothing has ever happened to me. I am always alone at late hours of the night in bad areas, so all those things they say you shouldn't do
Uhmm, uhmm.
I've done all of them at the same time and nothing has happened to me.
The
I remember what I have done and I say to myself, how did I dare to do that?
What was I thinking? I was a very irresponsible teenager, but nothing happened to me.
None
So, I don't know, I don't feel insecure, I have lots of reasons, but you do? Have you met Philly
Good, I don't, to me
What's it like
It's the same old story, right? Nothing has happened to me either, I think i live in
Here, close to the university, I live in Walnut between the thirty eight and the thirty nine
None
It's not that far away and there are lots of police here,in general, I haven't met anyone that has gone through that, so I really think that
I read it in the paper, so it does happen.
Yes.
I think that is strange; because, around here there are so many cameras.
Yes, we do too.
Lights, and cops  have some phones and  bike. it's unbelievable
They spend lots of money towards that, but they're generally keeping us safe.
Yes, they have lots of them.
The people from the neighborhood for example, criminals right? They have to be careful with the security in this area.
I don't know if it is very safe for the people that do crimes.
Before security was so strict on the quad, you could pass a card there to someone else.
And then they would go get him, whats his name? the system, to see if one was actually a student from there, or not.
They didn't make an illegal copy of it, right? But now,
OK
People could of gone in and out but they now have security systems.
You can't do anything at all, right? so in general, they don't worry about someone in the university.
Yes
None
Yes, in general my, in philadelphia, there are a few zones were I'm wouldn't go.
Yes
I don't like it at night in the center city, there are a few places where I dont like walking, too.
No
I don't know the city that well or the people.
Yes
In Mexico, I would see someone and then cross the street.
None
Here its like I don't know, its like I'm scared about something or someone.
Yes.
No
Philadelphia has lots of neighborhoods that are dangerous because
Yes
They have secure neighborhoods right? One from the university is secure, but
One goes towards north Philly, south Philly, and west Philly.
So it really gets dangerous, so, it does for example, if one wants to go out at night, they won't go to north philly, so it's not that,
Important right?
None
For us
Yes me too.
Why yes, if one goes out, one goes to philadelphia, but that's an old city, so they have cops and everything.
So
Why don't you know anyone in Philadelphia that knows history about robberies
In general, the majority of students stay at the university, not in the old city
None
I think people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood.
In general, every week there is
There was a robbery so one naturally thinks, what's happening? Right? But
None
In reality its im, one thinks that they will get jumped, or will jump two hundred students, but there's twenty thousand students, so the probability is that,
That happens to one
Yes, also
Of course it exists, right? but is not that tall
Is it that much more expensive
Yes
The forty-third, that is how it always happens they can not do that either
Yes but that also seems to me, that it is better to live like that in something like university high-rises because especially if one returns over there in the night and
It is very calm
It is nice to have
Do not worry about anything
To walk for a long time, the people that live like that in Baltimore but the squares in Baltimore are huge, they must over there
Yes. There is no light.
Yes, huge.
No light
There is no light.
On the blocks
There is no ligh. But, in the high-rises it is better, more calm ones do not have to buy all of the furniture
None
If something happens, one calls the university and they take care of them
Yes
I've heard alot of stories of people having problems with people they will with.
Hi
Hi. Who am I talking to?
Hi, I am Olaya, in Philadelphia.
Olaya, I am Arthur
Are you spanish?
No, I am from Mexico
And from where are you calling?
I'm from Philadelphia as well in fact.
Good
What do you do in Philadelphia, work or study?
I am currently studying.
Okay.
At UPenn
Me too.
Yes, what do you do?
Yes. Chemical engineer. An undergraduate
None
And you?
I am in the linguistics program
Do you have something to do with this program?
No, I know people who wear it and I know the LCD and what they do.
Okay.
No.
How final are they making this program, or what is
The LDC, what they do is collect many types of linguistic data, whether that's text, something spoken, and then it can be used for many things, for example,
None
Programs that can understand voice, need training, they don't need
Oh, okay.
A supreme being
Ok
For this it's possible and,for studies of for example how people pronounce the letter this way, up to the dialog, how it develops,
Wow.
The LCD collects data for many languages.  And then the people
None
Can do more things, more applications, more studies, or more theories?
More specialized.
Yes
Wow, okay. And where do you live here in Philadelphia? In what neighborhood?
I live in West Philly, but not very west let's say I live at forty-third and Spruce.
That is not not that west
No, too much west
Yes I live in campus
And
I live high
None
In the skyscrapers
Mhm, mhm.
And how do you feel the air, living so high at 43rd?
I like it a lot.
Yes
They said good, that Philadelphia was a little dangerous and such
Yes
Caution with West Philly. In the guide that spread on campus, they say it's dangerous to go out at night.
None
Right. This is my second year now.
None
And I truly didn't see nothing and no bad things happened to me. I don't feel unsafe either, in general. Could be that.
Watch few things, the news around here they scare you a bit
Yes, that
I would say nothing bad happened to me and I feel safe. I don't feel like I am in danger.  I know people that do feel like that and they get scared about West Philly.
Yes, the black people, there are lots of them that gets intimidated by the black people here
Right
Eh to me
That is his problem, I don't know
But how a lot of people associate West Philly.
Yes.
The neighborhood of the black, and then, unsafe
Yes, that too
But
Tell me
I am not frightened because I have a friend who is near forty-five.
None
I walk over there frequently and at night too.
None
When I cross the park at night, I sometime meet a lot of people.
Yes
There are lots of people there at night. At two in the morning they are rumbling
They never threatened me. They never asked me for a cigarette.
Mhm
No, I don't see them provoking
No. Its true that things happen, I know a girl that was attacked. No?
OK
Those things happen in every city
Yes, all
And in every city there are crimes and I don't know, but I do believe that here
Yes
They give it attention, and it's still repeated a lot. It shows up on TV, and in the newspapers. It ends up creating a collective state.
Yes
Of psychosis,no?
It's exaggerated
Yes.
It's more the idealization, like of what they are thinking
None
They are making it more serious than it truly is.
And, West Philly, has some not very nice areas, but it also has some very nice areas and is very nice to stroll around.
Yes.
People that live in Center City, that never used to happen, no? to come to have a stroll around here
That? No.
In my opinion, I think it's a nice neighborhood.
Yes. I don't dislike it at all
None
I mean, Its not particularly pretty, or nothing, but, i mean, its like you say, there's some good places to walk a bit, and
Well, living here as  university student. Everyone lives here. So at the same time you don't want to be too far away from here because then you get disconnected from the university place and students.
Yeah
Me too, I think.
Yes
The people live in universities are comfort
I went traveling to sesenta street
Yeah
I wanted too see what was going on
What did you find
I found a neighborhood, a poor neighborhood, it was ugly, a few houses were old, or not taken care off
None
It was poor in a few places.
Yes
There wasn't anything disgusting, or something scary
Yeah
The income for those kinds of neighborhoods, less than others.
They make a lot less, yes
There aren't any white people on the streets.
Yes.
Those are the things that have surprised me the most about Philadelphia, no? The division so large that there is still.
Impressing displacement
Yes,
It is impressing to see that, the more you go to the west, Black people are more than Whites.
When I take the bus, I get on it in front of my house. Sometimes, when I get on the bus, I see weird things.
Yes
The advan- Go eastbound, and then westbound, these are opposite, and one thing.
Yes it is true I have used the bus only once.  But I do recall getting on and then noticing
There is only black people from eas- to the west
Yes it's strange.
I have always said, the result of this action causes the black people here to have a lower income.
Sure, sure. It is a relationship with social class. No more than something racial, it is clear, yes.
Yes, more than anything. It is simply just that. But,
Where you from Mexico?
From, Mexico City.
They say that it is dangerous, no? Or, that it is.
Yes, over there, over there is a lot more serious
None
There continues to be a lot of segregation of social classes
OK
I have like an appearance that is much more European. I am blond, with white skin and light eyes,
None
And if I walk through some neighborhood, there in Mexico, kind of unsafe,
None
Sure, I am going out with a purse.
Wow
It is not going to take long to catch me.
Aha
And, they might even kidnap me. It is more probable that they kidnap me.
That I had also heard, kidnappings like that
Who they kidnap? It is no longer because you are from a family
OK
They take him in a care, and they call it express kidnapping.
None
Thousands of dollars, if you have much more, well,But, what you have
None
Like very desperate. They do brutal things
Yes
Do you understand me? This is terrible. There has been too much social conscience reguarding the citizens. Now they are starting to oppose the issue.
People now do oppose
None
There has been much more involvement.
People didn't do it before
Yes. And because the security system didn't work. So someone declares a crime and
None
It was a lot of paperwork that did not work.
Yeah
The policemen well reaffirming the action
Mm
People will feel there is more response, if more thieves and kidnappers are caught.
None
Those reports
None
There was a march in Mexico a couple of years ago
None
About one and a half years ago. That was called the Silent March for the Security of Mexico, where everybody walked to
To the city Zocalo
None
And there were millions of people, it was crowded
Wow.
I mean, you can see them, everyone dressed in white, and everyone in the streets
Wow, impressive!
Then, you can realize that is real, something socially needed. I mean, people is already
I understand
Much more attention to the security
No
Anything else
I don't know how it looks TV in Mexico
Causes the fear, right? Because news are very local and very
Yes
They explain each robbery over and over again in different ways.
Yes
Actually
Yes too much sensationalism, let's say, right?
Yes
But yes
And,
In Mexio it is very excessive that
OK
Practically impossible to include every robbery or every
None
Rape, I don't know
None
Every mugging there is. It's just the ones that are really big. When there's a kidnapping
Sure
Bery drastic kidnappings.  It is like the case of the Juarez deaths.
Alex and Besy
I see, it's Javier.
Hello.
Hello, how are you? I think this is good. I've never served as a jury but I'd like to do it someday. I don't know if you
I got a letter last year
Did you?
I refused to serve on a jury.
No, you know, I've heard that it's quite hard because it causes lots of trouble
None
Maybe you have problems. They have your record, your info about courts. It's safer that way.
It's dangerous because it depends on which case you are serving
It's a
I see.
If you get a murder case
Yes
What is it called?
Well, a drug dealer or something?
I see. They can have friends but let's say, okay he's guilty, so he can talk to his friends and say go after this person and kill his children.
She looks like this
Yes
They can make your description and
None
They can, that could happen too but I don't know they say that it's optional if they send you a letter
None
Is it optional or mandatory? I'm not sure, really.
No, I received a letter that said no, but I sent a letter to the doctor
None
Saturday and Sunday.
None
So, they said it was fine, they said it was okay for me not to serve on a jury
Sure
That was last year.
Yes, a friend of mine got a letter like that. He's working from six in the morning to four in the afternoon. So, no he said.
The manager of his company said he was someone who was not able to skip work, no?
I guess that he asked him for a letter.
Exactly.
To be sent to the jury so that he
Yes, but I don't know. Somethings I think it'd be fine to attend in cases like
Rapes of boys and girls
None
Yes, you can serve as a jury and yes, how's that? If you can tell the person is guilty and
You can help justice be served quickly. So I think it will be good to serve on a jury.
I wouldn't want to be on one
None
Because I cry a lot, and
Today, I cried.
No, it's because if something happens or is about the rape of a child, or if they play a video, it's something,
I see, you wouldn't be able to stand it, if it's really horrible stuff
Yes
Where did you sent, the, in which state?
No, I live in Canada
You are living in Canada.
Yes, and you?
I'm here in New York.
Yes.
I was trying to tell you about a friend of mine, he's in Arizona because I used to live in Arizona
I see.
And then, do they have the same system in Canada,
I kind of believe, but I don't know.
Oh, that's good. Well,
Yes
We have to be careful
We have to be careful, depends but they don't tell you of what, of what type of case, until you have arrived, perhaps, to where the judge or to the
Oh, or so you, no, eh
Where it has to be
I imagine that it should be a meeting or section to say, explain the case
It is everything that you will do it,
You are already involved
There is jury duty.
There
There, and yes you said no, then I don't want to do it then, too late
No. Too late.
They said yes
When was it your name
Besy. Besy, there
Petty, Sessy or Jessy?
No, Besy, with ~B
Oh, Besy.
There. And yours, Javier?
Yes
The mine is easy.
Oh, are you living in Canada, then? How long?
An e-mail address
Fifteen years
Yes
How can you resist the cold?
Well, I lived in a town before where the winter was really cold and had enough snow.
I see.
Enough snow fell
Yes.
And then, my husband and I decide to move to the beach
I see.
In another province.
None
And then here the winter is like rain
None
Doesn't get cold.
I see and in what provinces or states?
Is a province, is British Columbia, when I live is around to Vancouver, I don't know if you are going to the city
Vancouver, I see is not around of Washington State?
More or less, already.
Already, no. I had plans to go to Vancouver, because there were some friends from Bolivia.
Oh, aha.
But I lost the trail with them and I couldn't go, because they say to me that the life of them is very calm, I am not sure if this is true.
A person with whom I spoke before told me you will live in a paradise, and I say: why?
Because there are several islands all around and the Mar is very near and one can go to the United States.
None
Do you have a passport
Yes
You can go alone, crossing the border.
None
From here the border is about 10 minutes.
Yes.
Yes, Washington, already.
Where are you originally from?
El Salvador
Yes, I see. I am from Ecuador.
None
Yes, because you have a bit of an El Salvador accent, and some day I'll see if I can go there. Because here,
Already
Here much like the justice theme, here sometimes things aren't good
Ya and hay
And his. How?
I'm sorry
Tell me
No. There is, how do you say it? That, let's say you kill someone and they give you the death penalty.
None
Is there in some state from there?
Here in the United States?
The death penalty, yes.
Of course, yes, they give you the chamber penalty of gas
Yes. But I was seeing something in the news the other day, that this woman killed her three children.
None
She lives very close. Like at one, not even two miles of distance from here.
Oh ya yes yes yes yes
And so my mother says, no, they should drown her and I say better they put her in jail because she'll suffer more
Other people in the jail know what she did.
Ya
I say that they're going to piece I say
Of course, the mistreatmentor the bad step but imagine that a serial killer that killed someone
The gas chamber? Do they have to be punished? A few years
And, of course, something that will not cause suffering. Because if you kill one and
Yeah, right.
They suffered, what, ten minutes or whatever it was but if they put him in jail the other prisoners...
None
Poor thing
No.
That people suffer I am saying.
Clearly you can deduce that.
He's going to pay for what he did.
Why do people do things?
Yes
Yeah, but then
Do you think that people are crazy?
The people are crazy.
None
And as I say here it's getting hard each time you listen to the comments that,Canada had were more calm.
Now, there's something more calm.
Yes
Because I imagine that the health care of the United Sates not as good.
What do you call that card that they give you for health care? I don't know what it's called.
I don't know here, Medicare
Yes, Medicare
Yeah.
No, it's not so great.
Yeah, exactly.
Or is it?
Over there?
I would say that it's good
Just that it's more fair
Here it's more fair that
Today, that's great.
Then, over there
What is the job market like here?
Well they are looking for a lot of people to work construction
What kind of construction?
Sure, I think it's for constructing buildings or something like that.
Yeah.
They asked in other states.
None
If you have experience doing so build buildings or houses
I agree.
Guess we can ask or visa, or something, I do not know
Not because
None
Because I was hearing that Canada needs a lot of people.
At least in the province where I heard on the news yesterday that they were, they needed people to
For this to work on construction
Yes, there is a program, on the internet that if you accumulate points, as seventy-four points, and one would
Can go to work, and the government helps all
To where, here?
Yes
Oh, Dever? I did not know that.
Yes, it is.
None
Yes. It is that you can
None
My interest in that activity is 50%.
Yeah
Would be good
Okay
And have you ever had any problems with having to go to court or that?
Me? No
Yes.
Hello?
Hello? Sorry.
Hello, yes. No, It's fine, what is your name, where are you from?
John from New York.
My name is Jennifer, from New York
And you? I see.
OK, so we are going to start this thing? finish quickly.
Yes, what was, the topic? Did you hear it?
The subject was interracial marriage
I didn't hear it well
Oh, yeah that was today's subject. So what do you think about interracial marriage?
I don't care. After that, you are in love with someone
None
Yes, marry whoever you want
Okay. I
No. I don't think I care. Nobody should care either.
It is easier for certain races to get married like whites and the Chinese.
Not me
Lacks and hispanics, things like that, they wanted to know
I don't think that it is easier, but it is more no no better, because, like a Latin person with a Latina it depends where you live
None
Probably lots of people will criticize
Yes they always criticize, the do it if you get married
Yes, we are.
Yes you are, if you marry a Spanish girl
Yes, but all the races, what race you are ?
My father is Dominican
Mother?
Both of them
Both Dominican fathers. Good, I'm Puerto Rican
Yes, good, my husband is Puerto Rican too
Yes
That was a problem too
With his
With his family, obviously, they don't like Dominican people too much.
Yes
Yes however, when you look around, the race doesn't count too much because my husband says that too. If we got into details
Of every family, it could be a family situation
Yes
In my family there are a lot of professionals, we're a lot more educated
Yes
In some economical things we are more stable
Yes, I
The only reason they had to not like me was that the last girlfriend, years before meeting me, was Puerto Rican.
And I'm from Dominican parents, born here, raised here.
Yes, I have some Dominican family
Yes
I have many cousins married to Dominicans.
None
And they have dump.
Yes
Divorced and else
Yes
I have a lot of Dominican friends. They are my family.
Yes, I can't understand the ignorance.
I have a family also. My cousins are married to brown guys.
Yes, my sister in law is Afro American, she,
Yes, where from New York are you?
How?
Where from New York?
Manhattan
I'm in the Bronx
She was born in New York
That's what i think too
I get it, and for me it's not so big when both are happy
Yeah
No, I care less they are green or yellow,
I went out with different types of girls
None
I don't care. My first girlfriend was Dominican
Ok, and then, the funny thing is we're not all equal
Yes
Because I have some family members of my own that I don't get along with very well.
I have some Dominican friends
I don't like them
They stated their Dominican, don't tell anyone that they are, they treat Dominicans bad.
Yeah
Because of that, they are a bit rude and all, and he says I have, and they don't because their family says that, too
None
How they call them sometimes, rude, and all that stuff and the are
She's two, right?
They are quite nasty
Yes
They feel ashamed to see. I said, that does not need to make them feel ashamed, because it is there in all races.
I love telling people in my professional life I talk with all kinds of people.
Where are you from? I am Dominican.
I know one guy,
I believe it was you
No I know a guy who is a policeman, I am a policeman, right?
Hm mm
And me, he always, he has tattoos with the Puerto Rico flag
None
And I always thought he was Puerto Rican, until two or three weeks ago, when we made a barbeque for no more than three weeks, to say summer goodbye.
None
He was talking there and the wife was talking there. They said he made the vows to the flag and he was not Dominican. He made
None
Such, like when he made himself a citizen here
Hmm
And he always said that he was Puerto Rican and changed all his documents to tell that he is Puerto Rican
But this is
He was not born here, but he changed everything that the parents
Your friend is ignorant
I said, but why did you do it, then he said, because those people don't talk to me. He doesn't
You know
He doesn't want to know anything Dominica. There are Puerto Ricans who don't want to know anything from Puerto Ricans.
Yes
I am Puerto Rican
It is that, no?
They never change. I don't know why you should change it.
Exactly
I am I am an American, Puerto Rican American
That is he doesn't have, I'm sorry, that is ignorance.
I am Dominican, I can't change it.
Yeah, that.
Not like him, who has been paying and paying to change everything.  He says he is Puerto Rican and from New York
And still you, being you, know that they have nothing to do with that.
Hm mm
That doesn't change at all because still.
Where I am working now
None
Here in the Bronx there are many Dominicans.
None
Lots of people say, Oh, the Dominicans are gross, they don't know how to do anything.  There's a lot of Dominicans.
There are classes in all the races.
There are more Dominicans than whites
And now because of this you have Dominicans, that love to multiply.
Yes
Have kids.
No and then the Puerto Ricans don't say anything. Because like they say, the more Hispanics come, more Latinos, the better.
Yeah
The little whites are the ones that have a lot of Dominican and this one
Yeah
Puerto Ricans all one one of these.
You know, this
So.
Yeah, I feel like speaking English, I can't, we can't
I know, I'm getting up there too
This is because the brother is a policeman here in Manhattan.
Yes
I'm in my thirties and have a house.  I work mostly with policemen, some investigations.
Yea
In that
Yes
Just a moment. So, I always say, where are you from? Then they talk to me for a while, after I helped them, Dominican people say things in front of me
They said oh yes, where are you from? Dominican
Yes,  I speak like Dominican.
Oh.
But
Yes. No.
There are some who speak of them, and they fall  until they get the point
Oh, yes. No.
Sometimes we are talking in a group. Look he is a Dominican, so dirty, but I am talking with the group
Ok
Two or three dominicans, with two or three Puerto Ricans
OK
We chat like this.
Yes because
But
You can criticize a person and describe them like that Dominican in that corner
Yes. Because when I watch people on the street, I know they are Dominicans because they have a flag or something.
Okay
I am Dominican, I came
Exactly, yes
This way.
You know them because the worst Dominicans are always painted and have tattoos.
Yes
They have a shirt.
Also like women
Yes
From a distance for a reason.
Oh yeah? But we are not all like that. That is a funny thing because when I was in college it was Oh, where are you from?
New York, what ethnicity are you? I'm Dominican
Yes
I do not think so
Turn around
Unfortunately that's a trait we all have. But its the point of
We are...
Yeah,
No, no I don't mean that we are all the same.
Yea
Because I have cousins that make me ashamed, because they're sluts, basically
No, I didn't mean it that way. I meant it with the second part.
No, I understand. But let's get to the heart of it.
Yeah
They are like that
Yeah
We all inherited my grandmother's nice bottom
Right, it is always that way.
But
So what? if they are sluts, like you said
No
Puertorican,
Eh, we all have one.
Dominicans, hell yeah
So it's like, but, i don't that such a simple thing like you know you are Puertorican, i am Dominican,
Look at me and my family, with their own cousins, and everything.
No. Okay, now. But
I know that for a fact
Yeah, but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity.
Yeah
Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are like ninety miles apart? We're closer than Florida and Cuba
Yea
We hate each other just because of where we were born, what is that?
Dominicans and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us
Exactly, but I
The computer checking out the chatrooms
Hm
It's crazy how we are fighting.
It makes me laugh. I usually don't tell people until I'm asked but I never deny my race.  People will say something and I'll stand and say hold up.
Yes. I asked you why you're from New York because
Mm hm
What part of New York, you sound like you're white
Get out of here.
Yeah, you sound white.
Thank you so much. I speak Spanish like a white person, too?
But nothing, of course. Not now. Let the Spanish come out.
That's another thing that bothers me. Just because a person is like that doesnt mean that they are white
Yeah
You know what I'm saying.
I told them I was from Bronx and they hung up while I had three callers
Hmm.
They hang up on me.
No abs, please; I'll tell everybody I don't care.
In Florida Disney World.
Hmm.
It was a line and we were standing, the line was moving but they weren't moving.
I see
I had said, Bronx, New York. And they said, Oh, honey, come on, they're from the Bronx. And they moved, and they got off the line like
Out embarrassed.
No, it's not your fault
I was like oh well
Your fault is not to, people act ignorant around me all the time and say stupid things like that and it's like
Yeah
Hi?
Yes. Hello?
Hi, good night.
Good night. How are you?
Fine. Who am I talking to?
David
David. It's Joe.
How are you?
Where do you live?
Here at Connecticut, I think I already talk with you like a week ago
Yes, how are you?
Yes it was cut off by the call right?
Yes, i don't know why
I don't know why it was cut off
Oh. Yes. I don't know what they are going to do with that, because they have
Howdy! How are you?
So many calls had been cut off, and it also seems that
Yes
There is a lot of people that, i don't know, there is so many calls that they haven't processed. Therefore, it seems to me that they don't know how many valid calls
I don't know what they are going to do. For example, my mother already has reached the twenty five calls
Yes?
She knows that there were several calls that didn't cut out. So, she doesn't know what to do, right?
They still call you?
Yes, they still call her. I don't know, two weeks ago, yesterday they were calling here. But, I think they still are, I don't know. But,
They pay her just for twenty five, right?
I think so. But, yes, in the end, it doesn't seem very well organized to me and it surprises me because
The LDC did that a lot of times.  Last time was about two years or a year and a half ago.
Do it in English
But, before, it was in English, but they also had it in Arabic and Spanish. But yes, that's already an old story. They've already done it lots of times, so, I don't know, or at least once.
None
I DON'T KNOW NOW ALL OF A  SUDDEN NEW AGAIN
Yes
No,
It's pretty clear, because, the other time they had the topic, it was about religion,
And they were like for fifteen or twenty days it was all.the same topic.
I think the recorder was some type of computer
Yea
And that is what they tell her. My theory is they write the text in English, what they want her to say
That you could hear it. Right?
None
They went to the translator and put the text there
None
From English to Spanish, they occupied a computer or there are programs that don't.
Put a lot of text then computer reads it.
Right,
I imagine it was something like this
None
Then, what it talked about,
None
I imagine that it was a computer.
Of course
It didn't have a bad accent, but everything that it sad was when the calls ended
Your time is above.
I never saw it often, because when
I didn't understand anything.
Yes.
Yes.  Your time is above.  At one time the topis was dateing.
Then,
None
The translation in Spanish was to date. How do you like to date it? Things like that, that are
Yeah
Incredible. But, obviously they have people who speak Spanish, right? I do not know.
Yeah, it depends.
It has not been very well organized,
If you send them an email they answer you, The next day.
Yes Shudong but the good thing is that they pay well.
It's not a big deal, they pay well.
I did it other time and it was over
None
And I don't know what happened. They didn't call me again, and didn't have a phone number to call them but they sent me a check.
None
You know, about sixty days ago, they sent me a check.
None
Until I forgot it. I never knew
A surprise
Do you live in Philadelphia?
My mom lives in the outskirts of Philadelphia and I live in West Philly.
Okay.
Then at the University.
Oh, because you live in the outskirts too. Don't you?
That here
In school, you guys go to Penn State?
University of Pennsylvania is different. All the world is confused by that because Penn State
It is located in the center of the state.
Yes
And it is a public University
Right
And so the university where I am it's the University of Pennsylvania
In two diffferent, so
The other its much bigger and is public it is the countryside
Yes those that are and another thing like that. No?
None
Where the wilds are.
I have never been there, so I don't know exactly where it is
Over there.
The eighty one I think will be more
Possibly, because I know that the eighty one
For mine, it is the same
Yes all that I know of the eighty one is that, because we used to live in Tennessee
Northeast
Alright
We were living in virginia, but then we moved to Tennesse, but then we found out that the eighty-one passed through there, but that's all I know.
Okay
It seems like a long highway, but, are you finished or you still studying?
I don't work, I wish I could work and also go to school.
Okay.
I'm
It's a lot easier to imagine
When you're at school, you find friendship, you don't have to go out to talk to friends.
Not, the whole world relies in the center, in the same center
Yeah
But then, one is done and has to go home, and has to pay the costs of the house. It's hard. It's better to stay in school.
The good thing about being in university is that when someone is done, one's costs rise
Fixed payments, fixed responsibilities?
You need to have an effort
A lot
No.
The ramens sell for 20 cents.
Oh, yes.
If one could live off of ramon soups, it would only cost you twenty five cents to eat dinner. But then again, it isn't that way.
Yeah
You don't spend much less, but it's a life more calm, yes it's calm, but I think too that when the people remember when they were students, forget everything else so in the workplace really?
Yes, sure
Its a life that has more freedom, flexibility in time
Every night I'm awake, studying and I don't have class tomorrow.  Don't care really because I sometimes don't want to go to class.
Yes
You can't say, Oh, yea I didn't want to go to work today.
That does not happen.
No, it is very flexible.
No, your skills
None
When you go to school everybody calms down.  The have family or are married.
They have children, and their life is harder.
A lot of people do not; because of the income rise obviously the work responsibilities you have.
Yes. So if you want to live life like the Americans, I am going to tell you that you know the American dream.
The American dream is they want to buy a house and other
The trouble is that i feel its that you have to be happy with what you have
A lot, right? so, one has to buy a car, and you want one, then another. So then one would have to start working, right? So that you could maintain yourself, while a student just lives there.
But can it be at the same time?
Right
Everything that one consumes. One goes to buy a better car, and one may do one thing or another. And then when one sees the money is gone, and one stays there, it looks like the responsibilities only fall on me. Right?
Yeah
I don't know. Right now I am happy as a student, but for now. Right? But eventually, of course, one has to save to buy a house. But,
I don't know, that is scary to me, having so many overheads. Right? Because, it's that one works
Yeah
And one feels one is not enjoying money. But also that, in part, is because one doesn't think of all the benefits that it gives to one person. But also
One has a car to go to work. Right? So, one has to have this, so that one has to cut the grass. I don't know, it seems like a lot to me.
Right.
A sample.
You are more, more responsibilities in life.
Yes, definitely.
But, you know, being poor in life is more difficult.
Yes,
The life of being poor, has nothing to do nothing. If you want to work, you work, if you don't want to work, you maintain it
Yes
You know
The wife maintains him.
More or less, same thing
Yes
You have to get one good woman, that could help you, who has a house or an apartment, who helps you. But
Yes
Life is like this.
Yes
Live and learn
I think that there is. It is because of that, that one has to be careful with
If you buy a house and then buy another you're not going to enjoy money
You have to be serious to see
Right
What do you like to do?
No but
And if not, it is not that. Then it is better not to spend money on that. Right?
You tell me. The large companies are giving you stuff.
This is what it seems to me.
Big companies they give you cars, no money down? They give you the stuff
