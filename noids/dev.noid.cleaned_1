But, he is in Puerto Rico

Often when I go to Puerto Rico, he wants me to change religion to their orthodoxy

How does your religion work since women are allowed to wear pants and reveal their skin?

When that happens at home, we go to church.

Women are beautiful. They have to dress up, because they are not going to go like that all the time.

None
Speaking of the lady that would be leaving, if she believed that she was going to a party, and her clothing were
She was so fixed up to go to a church
Yes
That she was going to a party that didn't seem to be in a church.
Yes.
I looked at her and said,
Yes
How would she be talking of that if she loves God?
You have to look good, as if you were going to a party
I unnderstand
It has nothing to do with God. when you go to church, you have to look nice.
All
All dolled up.
If you are going to church so that you use that to gossip about the others.
Exactly.
You are not supposed to gossip about people.
Exactly, yes.
But, she was like, I looked to here and said wow, my God, if she talks like this here, how does she
Yes.
Talks if she sees a woman in the street, showing her body
Yes.
None
Weird
None
I was going to say, Sir, were you born in Puerto Rico?

And I'm almost fifty years old.
Oh, you are young. My mother has

She's doing fine
Oh, yes?

Almost as old as my son.
Those are things when about when coming to the United states.
Aha.
As, trying to seek something, a better future for one's kids. No?
Yes
Then, that's where we're at over here
Uh, um.
Working as a teacher, Spanish teacher assistant.
Right.
I'm also looking at what are the chances of going to school to get a masters
Oh, that's good.
Yes or trying to find. Because you can live at home and everything, but
Right.
If you can take advantage here, it's not bad.
Correct. But in our countries, it's not the same when compared to here.
None
Here's a lot of poverty
Yes, madam.
And here there isn't, you can get a job anywhere.
None
Since my family stayed in Puerto Rico I have my mom and brothers
Right.
My nephews. And every now and then I go to see them.
Right.
But I'm not going to live there in Puerto Rico since I have my two children here.
Yes.
Though they are older already they still live with me.
Yes
Until they get married, and each of them has a job and they go live with their wives and their husbands,
None
I cannot go there to Puerto Rico, without worrying.
That's great, your siblings are in Puerto Rico?
In Puerto Rico
How did you come here first?
None
Did you come on vacation here?
I came to live in Florida with my mother and my young siblings.
None
From Florida, I came here to Chicago with my mom and my young siblings too.
Yes.
My mom moved to Puerto Rico
None
I stayed here, and since I got married, and my younger siblings went to Puerto Rico
Yes.
My Mom was coming and going. But, my mom doesn't like it here because of the cold.
I have heard that Chicago is pretty cold
She says that it's better that she is here
Yes
It's not the same
Cleary, so, her mom is in Puerto Rico now.
En Puerto Rico
Great
However, my mom is Catholic and my aunt is Catholic.
Yes
My uncle is Christian, and he reads the Bible
Yes.
And he talks a lot of father God, and he asks my mom questions about God, and my mom responds
Yes
But he doesn't like it because my mom, after my grandfather died my mom took out her eyebrows
None
Put holes in her ear to put on earrings
None
She put them in the water, and the children drowned.
Yes
My grandfather, my papa, and my uncle didn't like
Mh.
Because he says that women should not use pants.
Yes,
Because of their religion, in his religion
He is the brother of your
Of my mother
Mother, right?
He says that woman should not use pants because the pants were made for men.
Yes
My uncle is a fan of religion
Yes
He has a religion
Yes
But one thing is, he does not tell his children to get in the religion.
None
His own children does not say anything
All
So then I say to him that to believe in God, you do not have to be seven days a week in church
Of course, Madam.
But he's in church seven days a week
Yes.
He says he's going to the church Saturday from the early morning
None
All night and all day Sunday in church.
None
He is a fanatic about the church.
Yes, ma'am.
I have a Christion friend who says she goes to the church.
Yes
Yes
Of course.
My uncle goes seven days a week.
YES
He's always talking about God
None
When I go to Puerto Rico, I tell him
Hmm.
He's by our side twenty four hours a day.
Of course.
I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk to God, because even in your own bed, you can talk with God.
Yes, mam
I can't continue asking father God alone How is it? We only remember father God when we have problems and not all of the time.
Is
But there are some people that
Yes
My god that grants me to be
None
I don't believe that father God exists
I see
Hi?
Hi, I'm Milgred from Connecticut
Mercedes is from Florida
How are you? Good night.
Good night, too
None
Let's see what we can talk about religion then
Do you believe that join or disjoints
None
Or do you believe that if everybody were the same religion, we will be better or equal? Or it will be
What i believe is that
Will the world be better?
Somebody saying that we are all the same religion? It's impossible, because I think that there are always going to be cultural differences.
Yeah
Each person interprets unique religion its own way.
Yes, I believe it's the same and we aren't the same race so, each race has its own
It's doctrine. Although we are Hispanic, some of us acquire another in that sometimes they aren't either. Sometimes, some of us are a Catholic family and others in the family are
Are they adventists or evangelical?
None
Or they are from this others, the ones of the taballas, the ones who sells, I forgot their name
There are a lot of races and religions.
0
Don't get bothered with other religions.  share with any other religion as long as they don't try to put me in something I don't want
Exactly, not including you.
Not being fanatics, right?
The oppose it, but they don't feel forced.
Yeah
Talking to you, I think that it's that, what is it called, that the religion is separated because of difference.
In which one believes, the, the differences always exist.
Religion is like politics.
Exactly.
It depends on what point you look at it, Not the whole world will be in agreement, follow me?
That is why they say that one should never discuss religion. Not because, for that, I can't believe they put us to discuss religion in this show.
Mm hm, yeah, but it's good that they discuss everything, because if you look at it, I have aunts and cousins who belong to the evangelic religion.
None
And the rest of them are Catholics.
Hm mm
And in the other side of my family there are some who are absenteeism.
Hm
O one is talking of religion, an no one is talking about, you know, that you have to be this way, and you have to change, nothing.
My cousin's husband is an evangelical, you will almost always find him in the church.she does not belong to the church. They have a happier marriage than most.
She is only there on special occasions, mostly for ceremonies for mothers
But they celebrate that because they do not celebrate Christmas. There are also other times
Who are they?
The evangelicals
Okay
Evangelicals -- My cousin's husband says that he was not married by that religion, but they did get married at the church.
None
She dances, and she drinks, and he accompanied her to work and to the party
You haven't told anyboyd, you still have to stop smoking and drinking protein
If you make jokes of you at the party, rather than getting cranky, you know that this is not a big deal so you should just have a good time
Yes, you can get a person like that, it all depends on the person. But if they become fans, forget about it.
This is what happened in my house
That is
My mom is that religious
None
My dad did not believe in church. He never said why.
That is like my cousin as well.
All of us went to Catholic school
Oh, really?
Yes, always Christians, well
Uh huh.
That which we learned in school, we didn't reinforce at home.
Yes
My oldest sister is Catholic, my younger sister is Evangelical, and I don't have a religion.
You're not going to church or anything.
No
No
No
I am going to the church, they call a pious woman, stuck there all the the church
Not me, since I was married of that I went out, I went to the university, and I left the university, I already decided that I wasn't going to return to the
To a church, not me. The truth, that's interesting to me. The organized religion, no
You don't like it.
Well, I feel that I keep God in my heart. Not that I don't like it.
I understand
I live my life well. I married my husband he's Jewish, and my son is Jewish too, and we're going to bring him up Jewish.
Uh huh.
I do believe that one needs to grow up with a religion
I think that it's a very important base, especially for the children.
Yes, definitely. I
One raises them with something
None
They don't create a relationship with feelings towards anything.
Okay.
It is like they don't care about anything.
Yes, I agree that the kids do need well. And that's why they say
What a miracle that they accepted you in his family.
Yes? yes they are, really yes.
How do you say it? They are
Yes, we were lucky.
They all have the same religion and so they try to marry among themselves.
They are very, strict
Aha
But no, my husbands family have always been very understanding. Also the other son got married, the girls, she's not either
Jewish. And I imagine that maybe I was the second one. They didn't
But did you get marries by the Jewish, or did you get married by the Catholics?
No, we had a religious and Jewish ceremony.
How nice
Yes, and let's say then what I am saying, my son is going to be raised and I say it's important that he's raised with a religion
0
He will decide wha to do when he is an adult.
And what did they say?
I believe a child must be raised with a defined religion.
My youngest girl, the one that is bigger, they got baptized and are Catholic, but the youngest, though she was baptized in the catholic church, she also visits the church
The Evangelical church.
Comments
She doesn't have the chance to be bad
Their religion and she likes going with them, and I never told her no. When they asked me if they could take her, I
You know
I don't understand that, because when my mom goes to church she has to wear a skirt.
I tell her why it is bad to wear pants
I think the Bible says that pants are worn by men.
That was one of the
It is related with that.
Reasons, really not get away but from a little of what organized religion is, there are people who when it comes ot the Bible, too strict, well, they take it
Those are the ones who become fanatic, that
Yes.
They interpret what is written word for word.
Hmmm
It is like the the Iraqis with their doctrine that who kill people
The God they had, or what they believe.
None
Sometimes there is people with their minds, distorted
None
Interpreting things that should be unifying. Because religion must unify, no matter which one. Do you Understand?, I don't think that only because two humans are from different religions they
Must kill each other
Yes
I don't become a fan of anything. I was raised Catholic.
I helped at church, I belonged to the Mary's Daughter Club
It has always been my faith, the Catholic Church. I took my children to church and I baptized them, because that's how I was raised
If they want't to go somewhere, you must understand,
You can't believe in that, because the catholic church says it's different
None
And the great amount of evangelic or Jehovah's witnesses people try to force things up to your brain. They want to come to your home early and start to sell whatever they have
Sometimes they knock and I thank them and say: I have your book, And if they insist I say I'm catholic
I understand that so many kind of people exist.
They are no prudent
They want to transform people into their religion, but they don't respect
Yes
Right? It might be me, but
I had a lady that came to look
You're in sin, what do I know, but I've been a sinner since I was born. So let the Lord punish me when I get up there.
If they try to, I don't know they go and say such negative things, instead of saying well look, you can know the lord better, and what do I know,
I keep sinning and you're sinning right now talking like that
Hello
Good night. How are you? With Norma here from Atlanta Georgia. Where are you from.
I am Arthur I am in, I am in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
Ah, okay
Yes,.  It is pleasure to meet you.  Where are you from, Norma?
I am Peruvian.
My roommate is Peruvian
Yeah there are a lot of Peruvians around here.
From Lima, also Mexicans
You are Mexican.
I am Mexican.
Okay
From Mexico City
None
Very good. And what do you do in Georgia, study or work?
No, I take care of my kid. I am a housewife.
Okay,  very good and your husband is also from
Peruvian? No, my husband isn't.
Peruvian American
Yes my husband is American
Okay. Very good.
What do you think about religions?
Well, I think that from the times of like medieval and that
None
Religion was lost during industrialization. Religion stopped being something spiritual.
None
And became something more political and then lately now in the last time has ceased to be so political but even so it still keeps bringing many of the ones that are
None
Like the institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
None
But not necessarily in favor of an institution. And you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says, or in favor of what is said.
THE CATHOLIC ONE OR MUSLIM ONE YOU CAN HERE AMONG THE TOPIC THE PHILOSOPHIES ALL OF THEM
Use them to follow a good path of life more than anything
None
What do you think?
Well I I am very religious, I belong to a religion that is the Hare Krishna religion, I don't know if you have heard of it
I don't know very well how they are, what is the Hare Krishna about
It's based on Hindu philosophy
None
First we believe that you are a part or portion of God and we also believe in reincarnation. We have rules and regulations. We're vegetarian, we don't eat meat, eggs or fish
We don't drink alcohol.
Why not? Why don't you eat meat? Why do you think that?
Because for us, we believe that every life animal deserves respect, we have to avoid violence.
Okay
We don't eat meat or intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol.
None
We don't drink coffee or tea.
Yeah
We don't play around.
No playing around games.
No, and are you from any religion?
I don't belong to any institution for the moment. I grew up catholic, but now I'm twenty one years old.
I stopped following the institution around eighteen because I didn't have much interest in it
I felt that it was already in my spirit
None
With- not God, I didn't have to go to the institution to get that, so I started to read other religions. But more than anything,
But to get an interest, and lets say practice life
None
But I'm not, I don't like the institutions
But you believe in god
Yes, definitively. However,
That's really nice. Sometimes, you don't feel connected to a group of people.
Exactly
The really important thing is to have God in your heart and develop a relationship with God.
Knowing if it really is
Well it was to Utah and I met my husband there.  Now we are living in Idaho.
A girl?
Of course
Sometimes, related to that, it has changed so much, in fact, I study chemical engineering and sometimes people think that in science you tend to
To brake religion, to currupt it
Yes.
People who start studying scientific things are normally really religious
When they start knowing, themselves, they can explain.
None
You have more questions but understand that the world is not understandable.  There are miracles everywhere!
I feel that there must be a supreme chaos and a divinity behind everything.
A supreme being which controls everything
Yes
Religions, or beliefs, have a supreme being to help people be closer.  That way, in times of catastorphes of pain, you always
Ask God for help. Everyone. There are some people called atheists, and they are always desperate.
They don't ask, they turn their faces like that from asking god to help them
Yes that is it.
It's just it's in their heart, right? you just feel that there really is a supreme being that many times doesn't.
You don't turn to religion only to ask for help, but also to thank
Um of course
I think that many times, people become religious at certain times because they need help, but once they're ok, they forget.
Yes, that's why you don't in our philosophy, there's always a future a verse that says that when you're suffering.
Yes
One always asks God for help and one should really ask God to send more suffering because you remember him more
When you're OK , you forget your relationship with GOD.
Yes
When you do fine, you're very happy.
Yes, you don't remember
No, then you think that you are in control, not that he is, that you are in control of everything that happens and that one does the work, right?
Yes
No, but it's really that God blesses you and helps you in many circumstances.
Yes, true.
And, do you have a notion about reincarnation or something like that? Have you heard something about karma, have you read?
Well, I have heard about karma, and how karma is brought upon people. Right. If you had bad karma, you will reincarnate in another being, but for
I unnderstand
To improve it, not just clean it you have another opportunity to do your karma something good
Yes OK the karma law is the law of action and reaction, that one person in agreement of his positive or negative activities it has a reaction positive or negative
Okay
We said many times. Why there are so many things that happen to people
Reactions of their past lives that we realize actions very negatives and now it's from the negative reaction that they are suffering
Yes
No, it's not that there aren't people that are very innocent or very good people. It's just a reaction, like free will.
Not to do what we wish, God doesn't force us to believe in him, doesn't force us to serve or do devotional service for that
Yes
We have our free will. If we do negative activities many times there is a infallible reaction of the karma law. No body is free of the karma law.
Yes
That's what we think, what we believe, no?
Oh, I see. The Hare Krishna.
Yes in our religion
Do you gather with the hare krishna every week or everyday
Yes i mean now i am married i live here in apparment near to the temple we have
OK
The temple here in georgia and  atlanta, but before a live in the temple, It is  like an internal there, i was doing service not to krishna not to God
Yes
No, there are many kinds of services that we do- one if preach, one is sing the name saints of Lord, one is kitchen for the Lord, we offer food to God.
And do many different activities.
None
The center of your life is God.You offer him everything all your deeds, your meals and when you wake up in the morning you go to the altar and pray
Offer him our food, I'm married and I have kids so I have to take care of them
Sure
I always go to the temple and we are devout. Many people come on Sundays or in big celebrations that we have during the year.
None
Do you have something like a prophet, like Jesus Christ?
We have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada who is a devout of God and brought this knowledge to the West
None
We really don't honor him
What's his name again?
He respects Jesus Christ, too. It's because we respect other religions, other beliefs.
Sure
He brought that knowledge about Krishna to the West. We named it after the city.
Okay
None
What's the name of the man again?
None
What's his name?
Its called International Society for the Krishna.
What's the name of the man that brought you?
His name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
Where does he come from? Is he Hindu?
He was born in India
Okay
He is no longer in the planet. He already died and abandoned his body.
But rather, it is very possible that he has reincarnated in someone else, or he won't reincarnate because it has Karma.
Rather, he is considered a pure devotee to God, and he returned to the spiritual world.
Okay, then he will no long reincarnate
No, he will no longer reincarnate because he reached the goal in life in this world, in this material world is where you develop your devotion to God
Yeah
And to not get back to the spiritual world. And from the spiritual world, you can't come back to this material world to experience the cycle of birth, sickness, and death that all living things go through.
Exactly
Even the animals and humans are...
Ok,of course
No
Then he has already passed that level and he no longer reincarnates
None
Okay
He passed that level, he is already a pure devoted
Very interesting
I don't know if it's very interesting
How long have you been in this religion?
Who's speaking?
Good evening, Jose

None

The cold in Cornell is brutal. The cold in Philadelphia can be endured, right? The cold in Cornell is too much.
That is how it is.
I don't know how you are going to know about that
Yes. Wait a second, someone is knocking on the door. I have to open it. One moment, please.
Yes, of course
About four minutes went by
Yes it doesn't matter
They never open when I want them to open
But but it seems to me that this program they have had several problems with the computers that or the, or I don't know with with the gadgets really that call
Yes
Twice I have been in the middle of the conversation and suddenly it cut out
To me like three I sent them an e-mail to this Shudong, Shudong
Shudong yes
And it answered me, and told me that there were several people with that.
Yes
Another e-mail came from her saying that they had told her there were participants who don't speak Spanish very well
Yes those
When can we hang out?
Yes, Shudong.
None
Yes Shudong tells you just hang up but that is embarrassing but I don't know.
I've talked to one lady twice from New York that doesn't speak much Spanish, and I laugh a lot because
None
Her name is Erdestina, have you talked to her?
None
Ernestina and since I'm Josefina, we laugh
None
And I tell her Ernestina, Josefina and then
Yes
We laugh a little and she tells me about her family

I spoke to someone that lives in her house, and they told me she was from an island.

None

Not necessarily Spanish
Yes, but regardless she understands, well yes if one
Yes
If you explain it well she understands, look and this about the e-mail Have you bought? with You haven't requested?
No, never. Well, what I have is in my account because I have two accounts. One is Hotmail and another in

They go through the internet from website to website then when they find
None
A bit of everything, what do you listen to?
None
They put it on a list
They will find out so much about you.
They also go to the news group
Such a weird people
To the all all all and then it is easy that for instance that the directories, or for instance the hotmail directory, I think that there too
They look for names, Then create a huge list.
Wow
With that list they make a message right? and then they send it to everyone in the list, but the amount of work needed is so little right?
Mhm, mhm
And if two, or three people answer from the thousands they already earned enough money.
To cover the expenses right?
Yes, that is sad.
O but it is
With two or three fools they already molested all of us right?
That is horrible because I left it controlled by the filter downloading, I do not know. They installed a spam filter.
None
I asked for it and didn't buy it, but they installed it!
None
I believe that filters a little but not always the junk where it says junk this appears, like ten or twelve a day right?
Yes, it always happens that if I read an article that looked interesting to me, that what Microsoft what wants to do now, is that it is making something like that, a software that does that
One time I sent a message to the computer and something that I don't know broke the code
Very large
None
But it will require a little work.  Really? Then if one is sending an email or have someone write one and I send it, no one will notice?
So
And when the computer does the task, then exactly breaks the code, then Microsoft will give you a certificate via e-mail.
The person took a little of time to make that. right? if only one is sending 2 e-mails it does not matter, the e mail will arrive and will know that is not spam
None
Do not have computer. Don't have the strength like this processor. Can't make it work. Right?
None
This is to protect
Slow and they wont be able to send all the e mails that are being sent now a day.
None
At the moment, when some one receive an e mail without the certificate, one knows that is a spam it can be thrown away.
Or it needs to bring like a file or attachment or something like this
I don't know exactly
You want to open this e mail
I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I think it's a good idea.
They made it to me because I have one email with Yahoo.
None
When I try to send an email in Yahoo it asks me to decode something.
None
Saying that I wasn't supposed to sit down for long periods of time because, because I'm sick and I can't sit down that long, I can't walk long periods of time, nor be standing for long periods of time either.
Yes
Messages something like this
Yes
Put the pieces together, the the letters how they go
Yeah
But sometimes, it is a PRJ.
None
Tea, a number, and something like that
The numbers yes.
You had seen it. It is not like a crossword puzzle? No>
Yes I had seen them
I don't know if that what is
I don't know
To protect
But I think that the filters were not too efficient right? because if you think that each time that you can say well if I have
What is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam?
Yes
Who believes in the spam they know which one are the phrases that in general activate the filters right
None
They believe the message is the form that no
Not filter
That won't pick up the filter, yes then
Ah. And had you thought, in the forums like the Univision or Telemundo?
Yes once and a while
When you write a work like stupid or idiot it won't be collected?
Interesting
Hello, how are you?
Aodri, Hi, how are you
Very well. I am Miguel Angel, and I'm in Philadelphia. And you?
My name is Aodri and I'm in New York
You're in New York, are you? from Argentina, don't tell me
No, I'm Peruvian.
I'm sorry! Because you had the cho, I thought this one is Argentinian
You are not the first person, don't worry
OK
But tell me
What did you your name is ?
Odri
Atri?
Aodri
Like Odri
Yes exactly.
That's very good
What do you think of unsolicited mail?
What do I think of unsolicited mail, that it's a mess
Yes
That I throw it in the trash immediately
Yes.
When it arrives
I don't like it when I open my email and see too many messages.
It makes my nerves
Nine messages and I want to see who has written
Yes
They are trash
The email is a scandal, the spam
Yes but the good thing is that for example, the service i use for mail
Which one do you use? Yahoo?
I use gmail.
Gmail?
They and you can assign
None
They have a way of verifying if it's spam, and it will be sent to another folder.
None
Then, it works, no I am going to say that ninety percent of the time it works very well
I have Yahoo and it puts spam in a different folder.
Yes
And if you don't want to read it don't do it.
Yes. I think.
That is true.
I believe that most of the services of technical email now because it is like an invasion they try in any way to put
Words like it was a conversation, and it is not only in Englih because I'm going to tell you that
No
I also receive too much in Spanish
Yes,
My personal mail and my work mail also I receive too much
I only have one year here you know in the United States
In Spain it is the same, there doesn't matter the language
Bad things get to anywhere in no time,
Then you never have bought nothing from a spam
You know that i have bought books, tickets and all kind of things from internet because of my own initiative
If I want to buy a book or I want to buy some CD or I want to buy some ticket for a concert or to the movies or whatever
But that's it, because I wanted. I have never bought it because I received spam
When I receive something in my mail that I have not asked for,I send it to the trash directly,I don't even read it
Have you bought something?
I remember that maybe one year ago I  read an article in the newspaper about a man that
None
He loves buying things, stupid things
None
That he lives off of that, but I have never met someone that
OK.
That has bought from spam because it makes everyone angry when they see that blessed spam like this.
The greatest part of these things are that they sell you things of, they take your money
They sell you low-quality product
Some people who have bought this item, have said it was shit, and breaks in a day or two.
Or it breaks.  You know that they are not quality, because if you say
Yes
This is from spam and everything is trash.
Yes, it is in poor taste.
Yes.  it is like the sale.  And all those catalogues are....
Have you seen those catalogues full of really absurd things? Like that thing used to scratch your back.
Have you seen really stupid things?
You know something?
Yes, that for example, a
Spend money to things we need
Have you seen that comes out? It is like some booties that have a plug to heat your feet
Yes.
Mr with the feet well into the little boot, who
Gets warm the fee and I sometimes my mother is going to buy this
No but you know what I ever say, I say someone has to be buying this for them to do the way they do
Sure
And they put laws like that in the state of Virginia is illegal
None
To dens a spma, an electronic mail not requested
Yes
A lot horrible ones arrive
Yes
It is similar to the ones that call you by phone, that makes me crazy, when I see.
To the ones that call lby phone I directly say no
Yes
I am sorry, I am not interested
I am not nice to them, and they should take my name out immediately.
I don't know if it's federal or for the government but it was made by oro governor.
And you can put our name and if someone calls you has to pay a penalty because it says they should not call
Yes. I have my former boss. He used to do, when they called from one of those cards for a raffle in the house or whatever. I don't know
From the mortgage he used to say, Wait a moment.  And, he left them waiting and said When I have to talke to cutomer service about something, or talk to the credit card company for the bank.....
They always put me in wait for a long time
Yes,
Wait and he left them there and that one thing , he loved doing that
I feel sorry for people who work in those things.
I feel a little sorry for people who have to work and make a living, know treat a man, not interested and i hang up
I try to be nice.  You know that peole are working and making a salary by calling.  It is not pleasant for the telemarketers either.
That people mistreat and insult them, they hang up the phone without answering, because I have tried,
I was a student and I had to continue being a student but when I was younger
I worked as a telemarketer and no it was not selling no I didn't sell I
None
I received calls but not make calls
Yes
I was working for an insurance company in, Spain that was also a provider.
Yes,
Here that service is called, roadway assistance.
OK.
I called people because car had broken down. We sent a tow truck to take the car to a shop.
I worked eight hours a day and there is a moment when you've had enough with people calling you with their problems
Insulting you and telling you that assistance arrives is like treating you badly as it is not your fault because I was the last monkey.
I was just another guy in the company and I didn't know anything as whether company is good or bad and what they just paid me.
Answer calls and give a service the best I knew then you know, that's why I feel a little bad for people who call you
Because this people that call you, have no intentions of, getting you mad people that call have no intention of annoying you. The people that call you want to eat llike you and me you know
You want to have a job.
Yes
Don't know I feel a little bad,that is that that yes no that not because I feel bad I am going to buy a product that they sell, that that would be the height.
Least treat them fine and tell then look I am not interested that is it, because the people like they say do not have attitude here in United States
Yes
I notice the cultural difference and what in Spain we call an edge
Yes
You need to be edge because people get on top of the chepa
When there is not need to be on edge, then there is not
None
Now
Because is the same thing, especially when they call my cell phone I say
Sure
In the middle of the day or sometimes at work, I look like I have a lot of things to do.
Yes.
Nobody has them, but I have the balls.
Hey.  And count Odri.  He is Peruvian from New York with an Argentinian accent.
Good, this is a halfway big count I'm good first, I'm good. I was born here with Peruvian but also my parents are gone.
None
Good children of your country, anyway.
None
Neither of my parents have Peruvian decent, nor does my grandma have it and my grandfather also does have it.
None
My grandfather lived in Argentina for a decade
I understand
He was forced to take all of the Argentinian culture
That's what it is
My mother has very little left
None
And it's good that I have it. I have it very strongly, but it's because I worked to study in Argentina.
I understand
Hit me if I'm wrong but I am not a legal professional
Hello?
Greetings
Greeting. my name is jenny and i'm calling from new york
My name is Anni, and I'm calling from Miami.
Ah okay. Hello.
Hello.
Hold on a minute, I have a call on the other line.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm coming out.
Hello?
Yes or no, it doesn't matter.
Excuse me, what was the subject of this call?
Music
Okay. Well, start. Yes you want to start
We spend the whole day listening to music. I have a twenty-three month old little girl.
Oh.  All right.
And no, I don't let her watch TV, but I always have
None
That was her throwing a dish on the floor because we were trying
Ok.
Sorry
It's ok, don't worry
We spend the whole day listening to music
None
Classical or for playing whatever, and we listen to it in English and Spanish.
Oh, ok.
So when her/his father is at home, we speak only in English.
Um.
But when he goes to work, we only speak in Spanish.
I understand.
So, and you?
I listen to every type of music
Right.
I don't have a favorite type of music. I can listen to anything, even music in another language.
Right.
I spend all day long, listening to different music because, like they says, music soothers
None
Even the wildest animal is like that
Uh, um.
And I also work in the court. So when I'm not in the court arguing something, I'm at the house. And, in those moments when you feel the most agitated
See comment
It's the best moment to turn on the radio. And hear something to calm you and to put you back in the
Yes.
In the mode of thinking of what should be. I don't have kids yet but I lasted several years working in a day care
None
And that was the best, when one wanted to
Hm mm
One class of eighteen four year olds to calm down
Yes.
Put some classical music
We
And it seems to change, the entire more of the room. Because, it affects the sound of the human animal, like they say
Well we had a
So
Not a bad time, but my daughter, two months ago that she started to sleep during the nights, entirely
Okay.
But when she was seven or eight years old we would take her from our bed
No.
I had difficulty putting her to sleep and finally found out that music, with a sound machine
Hm
She sleeps well. And now, we bought her an iPod
Okay
Because I have a month and a hundred or more CDs
None
I can select whatever I want her to listen. Normally when we send her to sleep
None
The songs of cradle...
Ya
I put some music, turn on the sound machine
None
So we read her some books. And when she hears that, she goes to sleep by herself. She sleeps better. I then put her to sleep in the cradle, and in five minutes, it's done
She knows the routine.
Sleeping, yes, for that reason we bought the iPod.
None
She wants to have more than five hundred CDs in the car
Yes, is better bringing the iPod that
And then she's like, someday,
None
Then we bought the iPod with the money that she
None
She was my high school sweetheart.
Right
She worked in
So it's more or less like her vagrancy, what you did
Yes.
That's a good idea.
We did it. Well, it was partly hers and partly mine, because I have my music there, too. So, you know,
It's not going to be only her music.
Yes. So
No, it's not like that
Probably ninety five percent hers.
All
That is why we are in this place.
Uh um.
I has an earphone
Yes
When we bought it, i thought, who's gonna put a Walkman? that's what I'm doing now.
No, that's the best. Because I'm telling you the point of view of a person that was a teacher.
Yes, me too.
They cultivate their love for music, and teaching them to read.
Because it helps them with concentration, with the movements, if one observes kids sometimes when they listen to piano music,
With their little fingers as if they were playing piano. All of that helps,
None
I forgot how to say development in Spanish
I understood, don't worry
You're working marvels for the development of the child.
There are certain things that you may think are a bit crazy. I was telling him that I want
Yes.
I want to give birth in a bath
We are going to have our next baby,
Hm mm
In a week.
Oh, wow.
We're going to a maternity center that we have here
Yeah
My first one was a C-section.
None
No, and it wasn't because I wanted to. It was supposedly for an emergency.
Oh, Ok.  Sh quiet.  Sorry, it's the dog.
Okay
I'm sorry
That's okay.
Uh huh.
She doesn't watch any TV.
That's best
Ftentimes when we go to church, and they teach her with the little Elmo dolls
Hm
She just looks at me like what's that. how does she not know who Elmo is, and I say, well we don't watch TV
That's the best method to assure the success of the child. To keep all that away from him. That's the problem with my husband.
I tell him, because his mom was a little strange because he was always right in front of the TV.
None
I don't know if I even had a TV until I was thirteen years old. My mom and dad never bought a TV, we didn't have any of that. So he finds it strange
In the school system I was always ahead, I finished college early, he was waiting on me. Everything I've done, I've done it quickly.
And easily. And I always tell him it was because I didn't have all the distractions. I didn't have a TV to take an hour or two
One of us wanted to play music and my mom and dad would do what they could to take us for music lessons.
If we were interested in animals we'd go to a museum
Yea.
On the weekends, there was always something educational. So you grow up little by little, when you're, a teenager,
You grow up and you see the difference, and from your friendships you know about all that.
Yes.
Now I that am mature, i always tell my mom and dad, 'thank you so much'.
I can buy all the things I want. If I want an iPod, I can buy one. I have one.
Yes.
If I want a PlayStation, we have one here, but mostly it's just there picking up dust!
Yes
Because we never use it. I'm not interested and my husband says, if you are not sitting down to play with that thing, I won't play with it either.
Yes.
I also see the benefit of not wasting my youth away
Also, since we are having a baby, I was thinking that we shouldn't let her
Hm mm
I was looking for an educational show that I could let her watch
Well, there are many shows nowadays.
But still I couldn't.
Two have the approval of the school system
Yes
In New York
I know that I won't have a problem getting her interested in television.
0
And I rather try until she's around three or four years old,
Hm mm
She continues with her love for books and music. I prefer that we continue with that.
No
I'll feel that for me to be able to have a little bit of time
The most I'll do, if I do it, will be half and hour a day, and it's going to be a program that I know that
Yeah.
It's educational.
I don't know you, but I trust that you will do a wonderful job because of the way I hear you talking
Is everything that, in my mind this is what I want to do This is what I want to see and when I talk to my husband
I don't know But
But
I'm listening and I realize that he is good, you know all you say is perfect.there's nothing
That I would do different, so to speak.
The biggest problem we have is that we don't watch much TV
None
If you come inside our house, you'd think we watch a lot of tv, because our house came with
Came with those, fifty-two inch televisions.
Oh my goodness!
Last Christmas, we bought a TiVO.
Okay.
We recorded those old movies and or programs that we are interested
No comment.
But it is nothing. We never see ABC, NBC, or any of those.
Yes, that's the best
It is always the Discovery Channel or the History Channel
Yes.
But because of that reason, my husband is watching least television,because I don't want her to see telivision.
Yes.
Because when he is in the house, she is awake.we don't turn it on.
Oh okay
That was one of the difficulties we still have,he understands that I don't want her to watch television
If He is watching?, then she is watching
Is giving her permission
None
That is the problem I have with mine. I don't watch television. I am always in the room.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, my name is Zula of Texas.
I'm Manuel, of Chicago.
Hello, Manuel.
How are you?
Good. And you?
Good.
Are you a father again?
Excuse me?
You are a father again?
I am a father.
There wasn't any problem.
No, everything was good.
How good
Right, it is about five minutes ago I had my baby in hand
None
Why did they take her to eat
Is it in the house or still in the hospital?
The next day we left the hospital, after it was born.
How good.
We were only there twenty four hours.
He awakes every two hours
Yes.
None
Every two hours we must feed him.
None
Well they are nursing him.
None
So you don't have to worry about giving him formula or anything.
Well, it's not your turn to awake.
It's okay. No. That? Nothing. One or two times he awakes but only to be with them.
None
That is how it is done.
Speak with Jenny
Yes.
I also spoke with your brother but I forgot his name.
Yes?
Because, he began to do it. To study as well. Because, Jenny stopped participating.
How come you have told me nothing about it?
Yes, that's what he told me when I spoke. Because, notice that I spoke two times, i need it to speak to a lady from New York.
And she did speak a little Spanish; but, she did not speak it very good.
Hurray.
I send a e mail to the person of the studio, and I asked what will happened
Yeah.
And he told me to hang up quick, it will end the call, because it will not charge that call.
Okay.
Then, he sent an e mail to everybody in the world, saying that yes you speak with someone that don't speak good English and the spanish.
Do not talk to that person.
Yes, I also receive one e mail from them.
Yes
Your brother told me that Jenny read that message and then decided not to participate anymore.
Yes, I didn't say that I was stopping participation.
That it was thinking it was for her.
Ah, aha.
None
No. No.  I told your brother I was the one who sent that e-mail.  I did not send it for her.  It was said by the other lady who spoke no Spanish except for little words that she was able to say.
None
None
Because I think she speaks Spanish very well.
She speaks well.
None
It is weird you get in the car with her, she drives a Van, a caravan
None
When I was in Nebraska with them I drove once and it was weird
None
I used it several days and took her cd case
None
She has music in Spanish
None
And you are not going to believe it, she had 60 or 70 CDs
None
All of them in Spanish. I asked her, Jenny why would you have music in Spanish? Why don't you have music in English? She said, I like music in Spanish only. I don't like music in English.
None
Oh. I said, that's good.
None
She speaks very well, I don't know how long she has been practicing or speaking spanish
How long has she been married to your brother? It sounds like your brother's children are grown up now.
She had her kid from before
She already had
They're like about four years old
Right
Three or four years
Yeah.
She has children from her previous marriage.
Yes
Oh, they have only one daughter
None
From my brother
I don't remember what we had to talk about, but I was asking your brother if he has had problems living there, in Nebraska.
Since there aren't many hispanics, and he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no hispanics, he's the only Hispanic
Yeah
And, i told him that if he had problems with people looking down on him, or talking to him, and he told me he hasn't, that he has only had problems once with
With the father of another of the kids that were competing in wrestling with his kids
Yes, one of them is a wrestler.
None
Wherever you go you'll gonna find good and bad people.
Of course, it always happens.
Yes.
He said he was getting many invitations to attend Christmas
Yes, I did notice that. Since this town doesn't have any Hispanics
None
You know, in places where there are many Hispanics, many, they start to get along with the wrong people, bad people.
Sure
Americans start looking down at us, not anymore.
None
I mean, a Hispanic. They think we are all the same, they think
Sure.
And since there are none here, they don't have
Prejudices against them, yes
This one is Mexican, he's not going to do that, he's going to do this.
Mhm, mhm.
No, I think that they haven't met many Mexicans.
Yes.
Since there are no Mexicans there, they don't have problems
None
When Mexicans have a party, they finish at one or two in the morning and they play the music at a very high volume
None
And, over there there isn't any of that. Until just now. in a bit more Hispanics will start arriving
It's true. It happens
Yeah
And what music do you listen to?
Texan
Tejana, yes
I like it very much.  I lived a long time in Texas and I like the Tex-Mex one, as they call it.
None
All of that music.
None
And even though sometimes I can not find records of that, I search but it is not heard much
None
Yes, sometimes, when, my brothers come, or that I go over there, I bring music from there
You don't like Mexican music?
I like the nortena
Hmm
YEs, I like the traditional Mariachi, and Banda too.
No? Hmm. Oh, well. What about regular music in Spanish?
Yes.
What, of any country
Oh, I like to hear that.
None
I like to listen to Colombian.
Colombian.
Yes, music, there's lots
Cumbia?
Yes. Many like very calm music, no?
None
Not too loud.
Okay.
In my car I always have music, and when someone comes in turn it up. I like to listen but only very low.
None
Only more for, like that music can relax me at times
Sure, yes it is good to listen to music in the car. yes entertains us and more if you are driving alone is good to listen to music.
Yes
I am not one of those people that constantly listen to music. I have friends that listen to music constantly, and now that people have those Mp3s
Yes
EIGHTY NHUNDRED SONGS CONSTANTLY HAVE THOSE IN THEIR EARS LISTENING TO MUSIC
I do not like that much.
What do you think?
Yes, there people that can't, are not able to sleep.my brother, that lives in Nebraska,
None
There was a time that he slept, and if there was no music he did not sleep.
None
Turn off the radio; you can't sleep without music. He does not sleep at ease
Each one.
Yes, I like to wake with music. Thus, my alarm clock is also a music player. Then when it alarms in the morning, rather than the sound of that
Kills your heart.
Yes.
Is the music that we have here inside the music player. Then, it is good because it wakes you little by little.
Yes.
None
Are you going to clubs in Texas?
When you get to Houston you should expect to go salsa dancing often.
Yes.
Yes, I encountered a group of people there where I go to school, that dance salsa and go out often. But, now no. Now I don't have time to go out anywhere.
None
I became tired on going out because I've already been to the same places and seen the same people.
Always, the places were but too full of people. Then, I want to dance, and if I could almost not dance, and the people stepped on you or strike you when they are circling. Then, I was already tired of that.
Yes.
Besides that, you have to pay a lot to get into those places.
That's right
I go out, but I'd rather go to a quiet place
None
Where you just sit and talk
We have a dance salon in here. Mexican groups come and play.
None
Northern music, and stuff like that.
None
You won't believe this, it costs around fifty dollars to get in.
Wow. But why? Do they bring well-known groups or what?
Yes, groups. Still, some people are not lucky enough to get tickets. Some don't get in.
Wow. But that's because you live in a very big city.
Yes.
So,
It is a nice place but I did not like it.
None
You can't even walk in there!
Yes and no. That's the problem, yes
They are good groups from Mexico,
Of course.
The ball has a capacity of 4000 people, which are the ones who get in. i only went there once, and I really didn't like it
Yes
I don't go out that much, too many problems, you go out and
Hello?
I think the call dropped.
I'm here
Good night!
Good night!
I am Carmen, a Puerto Rican from Chicago. Who are you?
Cristina I am Chilean and I am here in Idaho.

None
What time it is there?
It's twenty to eleven
Late

I am from Puerto Rico
Puerto Rico
None
And How long have you been here?
I have been living in Chicago for the past thirty years
Long time
And you?
I have been living here for ten years
Wow
Not so long yet, but seems a lot. Right?
Isn't it cold there?
It has started getting cold, but it is not like Chicago
Yes, here in Chicago is very cold
That's right.
Specially the snow
I heard that is terrible.
Right
My brother-in-law lives in Chicago, too.
Oh, yeah? In which part?
I didn't see where they lived, but he goes to the University of Chicago
Right
I think they live nearby; i think over the University apartments,
Ok
So i don't know
You know today's subject, right?
Yeah, the music.
Right
What music? Being from Puerto Rico, what music do you like?
I like very much Bachata music.
What's Bachata?
It's soft music
Right.
When they sing that music it's, and Alejandra, Alex, well. CD's at the library
Yeah.
To listen to them. I also like Reggae. I don't know if you listen to Reggaeton, which is trending now.
I have heard something, yes.
Of Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Tego Calder, Ivy Queen
So living in Chicago, didn't you struggle to maintain the music you listened back at Puerto Rico?
No, almost
Because a lot
Its almost the same.
There is a lot of variety in Chicago
All
Did you miss that a lot?
No because back then
That's great!
Back at Puerto Rico, I listened to the Boleros and Salsa, but I don't really like Boleros nor Salsa because they aren't danceable.
I see.
They're more romantic.
I see.
But we use a lot the Merengue
None
That, like Olga TaÃ±on and Elvis Crespo.
Yes
Here in Chicago they do a lot of  Puerto Rican parades.
So great.
And they were invited. This year came Ivi Queen which is the Babe of Reggeaton.
In two thousand four Elvis came
What
Crespo.
Really?
Yes, then
Yes,here in Idaho, nobody comes, then.
No.
No.
Here we also have a Boricua party
That is so awesome.
And they are free
None
They take lots of music from Colombia, from mexico, from all parts of Puerto rico and then world
Then you don't feel as far from where you come from.
A ha
There is all that,
None
There is nothing here in Idaho. Here the only music is like Mexican.
None
I don't know what's it's called, but it's like skippy, or I don't know how.
Right.
It's music that i haven't heard in Chile
No
And of course, there in Chile you listen to music more like, boleros too and
Right
But of course you miss it here, you don't hear much of that. And no one comes here either. So you don't have.
True
Right.
Concerts or any of that. I missed it so much that Im now listening to satellite radio.
Right.
I have been able to remember many songs in Spanish
Stuff like Reggaeton.
Correct.
I had no idea about that, because it's been ten years since I listened to music in Spanish.
Because now here in Chicago we have a station that is nine hundred three point one FM.
And it's music in Spanish.
All day long regaaeton plays on there.
Oh, sweet!
Right, especially when you're driving in your car.
None
That you don't get bored when you put on the radio on high and the travels seem
Of course.
Quick, and you don't get bored, you can't fall asleep in the car or anything
Of course.
Listening to music.
Yes it's good having music in Spanish because
None
Because in English it's good but it's not the same
No, No
It's not what we've been raised with
None
Currently, I'm happy with listening to music in Spanish once again, because it really makes a difference
None
In my mood
I don't know if you're listening to the music when one waits for another person
I got the phone to speak, that music I don't like because it's classic and it's when you go
Looking ot see that
When you go on an elevator
Of course
You have music, for me
None
It's not beautiful, and they should change it to Merengue or Bachata music
Of course
Cumbias are beautiful
More animated, right?
None
At least you can dance
No, you go to sleep waiting
Yes
Look this very minute I was waiting fifteen minutes to be able to communicate.
Seriously
Aha. The other time, I was waiting half an hour. And when I went to communicate with someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven at night.
They already hung up on calls
Seriously?
None
My
How many times have you talked?
Twice with this one.
I've already been with this.
Yes
Is thirteen
...knows somebody in the university or they study in the university because
None
But then you can call and wait
No, they call you. You can call after five in the afternoon. You can call anyone after five.
To anyone you like.
You can talk more of once a day?
Just once.
Once a day.
Yes.
Yes, the other time that I talk, I speak with my sister, because we call at the same time.
None
My sister lives in Atlanta, Georgia
None
And I speak with her. She is who in the recording for this show when you hear to the child saying what to do and all that stuf,
Aha.
She has a very sweet voice that all the world love
None
Then when she did the recording, we could hear her and speak with her. That was the only time that I speak, because from there I don't speak more
None
So, this is me first time talking with someone else.
Good Lord! You are missing a lot, twenty three
I got my act together, and that is why I called. I was waiting for someone to call me, but nothing happened.
Because the last time they put it for politics.
Yes
I called and no one picked up the phone.  No one did it.
It scares. Is it not?
I receive calls each afternoon at 5 pm.
Ok
That if I want to pick up the phone to talk, but I do not pick up the phone because I do not know what they are talking about.
None
How is the music? This is the second time that I'm talking.
Sure
I have talked with many people from Nebraska, Philadelphia and Miami.
I see
Yes
I like the music topic. it was about immigration
I spoke too.
I do not like to talk about politics and migrations because
None
I don't know what happened
From, the politics, i don't like politics, but i talked about immigration, i talked about marriage music.
Yes.
About cell phones, i only have nine left to go thanks god.
And after twenty something calls, you don't have to call anymore right?
After twenty five calls, you wait two or three months, they then send you a cheque.
That's good
Yes
I will start working.
Yes, after five o'clock you can call anyone that appears on it, you dial the phone number that appears
Of course.
You have to call, communicate. But it has to be after five in the evening, that's the time they change the.
What's the theme of what they're talking about?
And is everyday different?
Well, last time, i talked about five times referencing marketing.
Five consecutive days.
I talked for about an hour. Two music, three marriage, once with cellphones. There are lots of themes.
None
They didn't change but ever since they've put a new lady to talk the themes have change
Sure
But first, you had to talk about a lot of topics. Almost always, they were the same topics, so people can talk
Sure
Look then
None
When you are driving do you listen to music?
I do, I listened music too but there was a lot of time that I stopped listening music and I started listening
Problems, conversation programs
None
About Politics
None
After a long time I get use to it and I forget to listen music and the days pass by without listening to music
I understand
The music really changes your mood.
None
Do you have a form for the rest of the day?
None
I started listening to music to have a better mood
None
I'm not sure, but it could be our Latin blood.
Yeah
But, one needs
Yes
Need that,the dancing music
Yeah
Yes, because here, I do not listen to much music of that style.
Yeah
Right?
No no merengue or salsa. Is it just regueton?
I like everything now.
Yeah,
Before, when I was in Chile I did not like salsa, merengue or anything like that. Now that I am here, I love it.
All
Now, the only thing I need to do is to learn it, that's all. But, I love it
Don't you watch it on television when they are dacing?
No, they do not have it here, nothing Latino, no merengue, nothing here.
No
No because there are very few Latinos here.
Yeah
Most ones here are like unique, they are Mexicans
None
On TV, on the radio, there is nothing Spanish, nothing Latino.
No movies either?
On TV no, none.
No?
No, nothing.
None
We are in the middle of nowhere
Bless you! Imagine that.
Yes, it's boring.
None
Boring; when I went to California to visit I was to-
Betsy, hello. How are you?
One time yes I am Tammy again
Here sitting, seeing what you can tell me about social assistance or whatever because I have no idea
Well, I think that some things are good but others are not.
Aha
Especially the one for older people. They don't give them enough money or it is not because of the money but that they need medical help. The pills are not completely covered
None
It is more difficult for them to take their pills becuase of the fact they have to pay for them and also  have to eat.
None
I know people well so have been abused
None
Of those uses that real people, that other people really need
None
It's difficult because my mother is a wedge between my husband and I.
Aha
And she is partially on assistance. They don't help her much. She has to search for coupons so she can buy medicine.
To buy a medication this month or another medication next month.
That's ugly
Because he cannot have all of them and that is bad because if you don't take things as you are supposed to take them.
No
You are scared, because they will not help you.
This is the welfare or pension
Mja or from welfare
I can imagine
Assistance that is given to them is hard to get, and you have to show that your need is real.
You have this and if you do what it takes to get it, you have to be working
None
If you do not know they do not pay you well, but they pay you a little more than twenty dollars from the
None
The limit they give you does not help, because its less than twenty dollars.
Yeah
It is twenty dollars over the limit, which is not a lot.
Yeah
They prefer that you do not work.
I see
They will help you, but it's not enough to survive.
But they don't pay you, let's say, for all the medicine you need?
They are giving you something but they can't. They don't want to help you.
None
They don't want to help you because you do a lot, supposedly, and a lot isn't enough. You can't survive on this, and you have to work so that you can make enough for them to help you.
And what they help you with is not enough. There are many ways anyway
Not that much, it is hard mija. It is very hard for persons to try and do that and  believe that is why some people work under the table
Yeah
They can not say that they are working because they will not help them and they have children
But after the eighteen years they no longer help. when your children have there eighteen years they will no longer help
No, that is why I was seeing my son that crazy comes to my home and tells me, Hey mom so why do you not want to apply to the government for them to give me lunches.
None
We make too much for them to give us lunches, but I will give you lunches and the paper/
None
Four children, wait four persons in the home they want you to make about Twenty four thousand dollars
None
That is not enough, in a year
Twenty four thousand dollars a year
Four persons not especially if I take those persons with a baby
None
Because I say that, it is a lie, I was showing my husband and I tell him them people are crazy, who is doing I say where you work and where you lvie because here where I live
None
That miracle that when my son moved, he found an apartment close to us, and it was seven hundred twenty five a month and that is cheap
But does not include utilities
No that do not include nothing them you can imagine with two
Ohay, more expensive
If a person has four people in the house and it has been twenty and four thousand
It is not enough
Because of that, I always tell my children to be careful, work, take care of your credit and save your money
They don't spend it on things that they don't need
Mija, do you recall now that I spoke with you yesterday?
You already moved back
My son is back, the oldest one that had moved this one in my house again he already fought with his girlfriend and the girl did something bad to him and that my son when you do something bad to him he says good bye and like that never will see you again
Boy
So he got all of his things, my husband went over there and took all of his things and there isn't anything else of his in that apartment anymore
Wow
Now it really happened
She must have done something very bad.
Yes.  It is very bad that this man got liek that.  When he called me mom I told him I support him and to come over.  I will convince him that he can go to school because
He was not working when he moved with his girlfriend.
The people from work said he can go to the school in the morning.
None
They will help him to work after that.  I told him if you go to school I will not chare you rent.
Aha, like that is good.
If you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because I want him to finish school
Of course, mja.
Because is going, I say too many things, especially with him. He does not want to finish school. It will be difficult to get things so I want
I will not send him to work at McDonald's
Something happens to him and asking for help
None
There is no need to not finish his things having us here when we can help him.
None
You don't wna to end up there, work hard
He does not want to have government nor, neither will help him
It's there in Canad with this insurance,
They make you work here when we just got here from El Salvador fifteen years ago and they gave us an apartment to rent and gave us
None
We had welfare, bed and furniture
None
During a few months from there, because we went to the school and from there my parents got a job and my brother and I were in high school
Because my parents were working they helped us because my brother was fifteen
None
I already had eighteen they did not help me; just my brother
Yes but they put me on welfare sometimes before, but I though that here they would help you a little because they give you a card for medicine
None
He had to present it at the store where he will buy the medicine and they will pay well. They paid well last time I asked for assistance.
But now I do not know how it will be, it should be more difficult
My husband was in the Air Force when he came from
Aha!
We arrived here and he also does not pay that much that was in like 92
None
And when we arrived here it was insufficient to be able to pay the rent and that we came into the program for a month
None
It took him one month to find work.
Great
He found a job within a month.  The next paycheck then took us a month out.  We came out one time from seeing him.  We came out once from seeing him but when one goes to the store, they are like fake papers.
For real?
The people they, when you go out shopping and that was years ago, so today I believe they give you a card
Oh
People give you mean looks
They look at you, as if you were from another planet.
I am not able to work because I can't, afford child care.
That is true
I told my husband never again.
No
I work whenever before I would get into that and has told me that under I do not put my family like that
No
So that because it is how they look at you bad I say no man because you are asking for a little help
Like
Because things didn't turn out well or it is very difficult.
Already they for sure, they the same thing happened to them and they give you a dirty look it is like that
People that don't recall about that
None
I am not like that when I see people that have in the need I say it can happen to anybody from one day to the next it happened to me
Yeah of course
So I say
Why look bad at people who get govermental help?
They are not stealing.  They did not just go crazy and start.  They are
Yes
They went because they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't want to do that but they had to
What it was like a little paper that said the government would help and the people knew
None
It's not money and they don't send you a check for yoour house or into your account
Well, they send you a check
None
Well, I remember that was in ninty-two.  You were sent a check and a little book.
None
Little like the Monopoly money
Oh, oh.
And it was like five dollars, twenty dollars and you had to take it out of there and give it to the person and they didn't give you change
Oh no
It's like you had to try to be adequate
The government would do it to make you ashamed
And so had to be sure that you didn't use it for alcohol such that looks bad and so I think now with the card it is better
Yes
Hello?
Hello?
How are you?
And you?
My name is Ernestina, and you?
Annie.
Annie,where do you live?
In Miami
New York
None
Yes. Have you been to New York?
No, I've never gone there.
How many years have you lived in Miami?

I have lived here in New York for forty-five years.
None
I am forty-five.
You were born in New York?
Yes.  And how old are you?
Thirty-six
Do you have girls and boys?
I have a daughter who is 23 months
That's great.
I am expecting another baby in two weeks.

None
Ay, how great. What do you want, a girl or a boy?
That's healthy.
Oh, that's great. And how are you today?

None
Yes, she has a two year old son
Wow
He's very sick
Why?
Very sick. He's two years old
None
No, a little sick. And you have a girl?
A headache
She's going to be fifty years old this november
She's travelled so many times on plane
Oh, how nice. No. Eighteen. Oh, boy.
None
She gives a lot of work?
She has her moments when she doesn't listen to what I tell her
But
Yeah
When I talk to her and I asked her to do something, she does it. Because I make sure that she does it.
Yeah
Because I want for her to behave good.
That's good.
Therefore,
None
Sending so many e mails, then it will delay more and possibly what is waiting is going to delay so much that I believe it will be too much.
Oh, boy. And you live with another person
Yes, with my husband.
Another.  Your Husband, is  that it?
None
You have one husband and one daughter, correct?
Yes
The other one that's coming?
No
Another girl or boy coming?
I don't know.
You don't know.
The only thing we want is to be healthy
It's hot in Miami today
Today, it was not too hot but it was cloudy. It was very breezy. The temperature was still around eighty-five, eighty six.
Oh, boy
It was a very hot day even though the humidity was not too high.
None
What does not affect much here is only the temperature.
Yeah
We have about seventy to eighty percent humidity normally.
None
And we you leave the house,
Yeah
When you get out, you start to sweat. It's like someone hitting you with a wet blanket?
None
Is very sticky
Yes,
We are getting into the time of year, we feel hot, but the humidity goes down.
None
I can wash my hair
Yeah,
I can be the whole night with my hair wet
None
I'm not parched because there's a lot of humidity.
Boy
Especially if I wash it in the morning, and leave it in a little bun.
Ah.
The hair I've left wet the whole day
Wow.
So, it's not the heat as much as the humidity.
Yes.
So its still cold over there?
It's cold maybe sixty degrees
None
Yes, it's cold today. It's very cold.
And when you normally have snow
What?
When it begins to snow
Maybe the other day. The other day was seventy, but today, it's very cold. And every day is.
The change, it changed a lot. Maybe today is sixty, tomorrow fifty, you know, so.
But, When does it begin to snow?
I don't know. I don't know.
I thought that it snowed in New York.
In New York, who?
Didn't you tell me you were in New York?
Yes
OK
I live in New York
Okay
None
Okay, no. I thought that it snowed in New York, that's why I was asking you.
Talk too fast
I'm sorry.
Where,you are from Honduras?
My parents are from Dominican Republic.
None
I was born in Puerto Rico.
Is your mother dominican?
My father too.
There are a lot of Dominicans in New York.
And Puerto Ricans too.
Yes there are a lot of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans there.  I live in the Bronx.
None
There are very poor people in the Bronx.
It has dark skinned people, dominicans and mexicans
None
In the Bronx, Puerto Ricans and Haitians
From Haiti
Do you know?
Yes, from Haiti
Me?
From Haiti
Haiti. What else? Jamaica
From Jamaica
People are very poor. They don't have a lot of money, here in the Bronx. Do you have a lot of money?
I don't think so. I mean, we have a house, but my husband is the only one who works. And we have to
Yes
No, we don't have a luxurious life
Yeah
We have enough money to buy what we need
Yeah
Pay the electric bill. But we don't have anything to go on vacation.
Yes
We have what we need, however,
None
We only have one care
None
Two cars.
You don't have two cars?
No, we have one car.
Do you live in small or a big house?
No. We own a house. It's a pretty small house.
None
We have three bedrooms.
None
And two bathrooms. It's not big. And around here, some of the houses are very expensive
Yes
I'm telling you, we have what we need.
Yeah
But, it's not a life of luxury.
What ?
And we are not starving. And no, we don't need more clothes.
Yes.
But as i am not working, i stay with my daughter
Yes
It makes us difficult
Is the clothing very expensive?
I think that, yes. Look, almost a year has passed since I've bought clothing. I buy my girls' clothes in a consignment shop.
Yes
We save a lot of money, but I don't go shopping.
Yes
Shopping because the clothing is too expensive.
Yes
So then, we normally buy clothes, we go, from shops like Costcos
None
Something like that
Yes
If we find something that suits us and is good, then we buy it there.
None
I don't do that.
None
That thing doesn't matter to me. I have a lot of clothes, I don't care if it's branded.
Whatever
Yes
It's not dirty.
Yeah
Hello?
Hi
Hi, it's Sulma
I'm Manuel from
Hi
Chicago, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, working
Are you working right now?
Yes
None
Yes, the call just came in and I said, I'll rest a bit, do something entertaining
Yes
None
A divinity behind everything
How are you?
Fine. You said you work in construction, right?
Yes
Where have you traveled to?
It's the best one can do
Yeah, sure, go on vacation.
Yes, Mexico
None
Nothing more to Mexico and in the United States have gone to different parts
And
Not work, on vacation
None
None
Where have you been in America?
Texas
None
When I was in Texas I traveled from there to here
None
I have family here and there
None
I'm coming to Nebraska with my brothers
None
I have family in Arizona; all my uncles
None
Almost the whole family from my mom is here in the U.S.
None
Plus, several states, I have other in Wisconsin too, I'm going there many times
None
It says I'm near
None
So, how do you say it? For travel? When you have time. I like to do it in the car, driving here.
None
Because you stop and rest when you like it
Sure
With the family, you have to stop to rest.
None
If you go on a bus, you are going to stop only once. And it's very uncomfortable.
None
And thatâ€™s all
You only visited touristy places in Arizona.
Grand Cannon
You went to the Grand Canyon.
Yeah
Do you like?
Its Beautiful
Yes
It's very nice, although it's very much like a desert zone
Of course, yes
But there are many beautiful things.
You have only been to Mexico to visit your family, or have you visited other places as well?
I have family in two states, Durango and Monterrey
None
There are many touristic places in Monterrey.
None
It's an industrial city
None
There are two, I don't know exactly what they are
None
They are very big waterfalls, very tall
None
Many people visit them from different places
None
It's very nice
And would you like to go to any other country in the world?
I want to go to Alaska.
Alaska?
Yes
None
Go to the meet and see what it is .
There it's very cold.
It is really cold.
None
I would like to be there
Yes. The boss I had before went to Antarctica, the South Pole.
Yes
Yes, to see the penguins, because the penguins are just at the south pole
Yes
And she loved it.  You can take cruises to Alaska from California nd then from Alaska to.....
I had known before
And then you get to see all glaciers and all the
Yes, I like enough to go to meet there
None
But sometimes, there is no time.
Yes, no
When?
It costs time and money
When you sometimes have the time you don't have money
Yes, it is difficult.
Ths is what happens.
None
How? Yes, tell me.
You tell.
What happens is that, I tell you, like when you have holidays, you, what is, that good, at least I try to
Go out to see my family
Right
Two or three years without seeing them
None
You have an opportunity but I prefer to see my family, taking walks, too, iI don't know
None
We are very united, we visit each other a lot.
Yes
And that's good. You have times that are better to go out and see family.
When you marry, it's  difficult to go see your family and go on holidays
Your wife or husband's family
That is another issue
Time is up and the vacation and money all goes there
Yes, actually time because I'll tell you that when you go see family I don't spend much like when you go to
Yes
I don't know that you go on a trip to see different cities or countries.
None
You spend more there because of hotels and food expenses.
Yes, of course.
Wherever you go you are going to spend money
None
To visit family, you do spend money. I won't say that you don't, however,
None
You don't spend as much
Of course, yes
It is very different.
I hope now that I started working as a nurse, and I start to have money that I'm able to travel.
That's great
I have been to Europe and I have been in Costa Rica and Guatemala. I have been to Mexico, but only in Mexico City.
In Puerto Vallarta and Chiapas.
Oh, Yes?
I was in San Cristobal where else was I in Chiapas? I don't remember. I was in in Taxco also, when I was
Taxco
I was in Mexico.
On vacation?
Yes, I have a friend that loves to travel and to stay long in other countries. She just got back from being abroad two years in
In Taiwan and when I ran into her in Mexico, she had been six months in Mexico and so she was touring the whole country
And I rant into her when I was in Chiapas
I returned, she stayed
Yes, I with the vacations.
She is from Mexico City and she was studying
None
She was two years old there
How nice.
Yes, when I did ten trips with her, I didn't spend hardly anything because we stayed at hostels
But, you can stay there.  You do have to sleep in a room with a lot of people.  But we did not pay anything.  We paid
Two dollars, or three dollar a night
None
But almost everyone is a student.  You have to share a room with people that you don't know but
At least you know you are not in danger with people.
Yes, they are people that
These are
Who is doing the same as
People who are in the same
They come to travel, and they want to spend little money. I also went to Europe and I stayed a month
Traveling to Europe ended up being expensive, but my parents helped me because it was my present for graduating from the university. But that was after I was in Houston
I have only gone to Aruba, which is off the north coast of Venezuela.
Okay.
Yes, and that is an island like Puerto Rico but I didn't like it. It is a famous tourist site in the Caribbean but I didn't like it.
Because Puerto Rico is also an island. Puerto Rico is a lot greener and Aruba is deserted, there is nothing.
Absolutely nothing, the only thing is the beaches are beautiful but aside from the beaches, there is nothing to see
It's deserted there?
In Aruba, yes
Yes
Yes, it is very dry there is absolutely nothing it's very flat and the only thing that there is is rocks, everything is very rocky and the
Beaches are also rocky
Yes
The sand is white and the water is very clear. You can see beyond the water, it is very clear blue.
Notice.
But no, there is nothing else to see absolutely nothing else
None
Like that so I didn't like it but that yes I am lucky that all my family is in Puerto Rico except a sister that I have who lives in Florida.
All the rest are in Puerto Rico. But now, for example, I went to visit my sister in Florida. And then in August,
I TRAVELLED TO PUERTO RICO TO VISIT MY FAMILY IN DECEMBER AND I'AM GOING TO CANADA TO VISIT MY BOYFRIEND'S FAMILY
I don't have any time or money left to go anywhere else
That's right.
Because I'd have made three trips, three flights, I have no money left to go anywhere else, so I think that when I finish school, I'm going to take some
Time off on holidays before I start again. I'm going to work to
Rest
Yes, or to go someplace where I want to go, a different place. Not just to visit family
Well, that's fine too. Because once you start working you don't know how your life is going to turn out since your whole life is going to change, right?
Yes. Usually when you start working they don't let you take time off.
None
I've heard of companies that tell you that you can't take time off during the first three months, you can't go on vacations, and some other companies say it's six months.
You'll see.
How is your baby doing?
Very well, thank you.
Yes, getting bigger.
Yes, he's fine, he's getting bigger, he was born on a Wednesday and we took her to the pediatrician on Saturday.
Aha.
She had gaind about a pound.
None
The doctor told us that it's very good that she gained weight because many children
They're born, they usually tend to get a little thin
Uh, um.
This girl didn't lose, on the contrary, she gained weight.
Right
She'll be too on November the 18th
Right.
I hope she keeps like that without having problems.
Yes. At first, they grow so fast.
Yes
So fast. Until they're two. Then after that, they're still growing,
Betsy hello Alex.
Betsy, you're talking to Alex again, how are you?
Fine thanks, and you?
Then the subject of the trips
Something interesting
Yes something interesting
Better that politics, than the politics o r whatever
I had a lot of different opinions.
Yeah
You want to start this time
If I had money, lots of it, I would like to go to Hawaii for at least two months.
I would like to say something.
For what?
The grandmother of my husband says that it's beautiful and I would like to go on a cruise
Is you husband Canadian?
Yes, he is.
Yes a cruise would be fantastic
I have never been on a cruise before. Have you?
Right I traveled one time to Spain
None
I liked Jibrartal and the southern part of Spain where the beaches are
Yes
Hey were very pretty landscapes
None
But I didn't have the money to stay very long
None
And that always frustrated me and then if I would win a prize and I had the money
Yes.
When one has money one must have time
Yeah
And then I would love to travel to Spain and visit the
None
There are many castles and interesting things there
Yes
It's interesting, it's to know history
None
And but one needs money, it's an expensive country especially for traveling
Uh huh
No it's not very dangerous where I am,Columbia is very dangerous
I understand
There one does not have fun, even though it is a beautiful country
None
One is always afraid of the security of the country
Yeah
No, Spain is better
Yes, if there weren't so many wars, I would like to go to Israel
Dangerous
Yes, but no if there was no war.
Yes
I would like to go there
Colombia is a fantastic country.
Ya
You have great scenery, some tremendous mountains.
Yes, I imagine so.
Yes and we have coast there but the problem is the war
None
The drug trafficking that has damaged the country totally and the image that they have of me is horrible
Yeah
Between the US is where you'd like to travel or between Canada?
Canada, I would like to go to Montreal
They have told me that it's nice but cold
Where we live now, this winter it's just rain and nothing more.
Yes
Where we used to live, winters had a lot of snow and it was super cold.
Where do you live?
Near Vacouver
There is no snow
No
Impossible
We're near the sea
Is there snow up North?
Well sometimes there is but the next day it's gone
Yes
And it doesn't freeze.
Because here in Los Angeles, there's never snow, except possibly in the mountains.
Yes, here it falls.
Yes
Maybe once every three months or something like that it falls
But if it falls, it must fall because you're very far north, Betsy
Yes
Yes, you're near Alaska
Yes. But it's not too far, because it's next to the Pacific Ocean.
Near Seattle Washington.
Yeah
Have you been to Seattle, Washington?
Not really.
I'd like to go there
Yea
Yes. Also Washington, DC. Once I went to the capital
0
There are some nice things there, like museums. I really like history, so everything that has to do with history and on the classic city in Montreal, Canada.
Yes, two years ago.
They say that Canada's really pretty
If you like the winter, I mean the snow
No, there's not really as much insecurity, like there is here in the United States.
At least I haven't seen anything too bad
It's bad here in the United States.
Yes,I think
It's almost like Latin America now
None
Yes, that is why they criticize immigration here a lot because it is a lot of immigration here and it is a bad immigration
I see.
It has spoiled the country very much
None
Throughout the years I have seen this country has really declined.  Now in the United States there is a big difference between the rich and the poor.
None
That did not happen before, I think in Canada there is more of a balance
None
Here is not that much difference between a rich and a poor person in Canada like there is here in the United States
There are a lot of poor people here.
There are more social prog-programs over there
Yes that is true
The problem here is that there are a lot of people.
I see
The country has gone down unfortunately
We went to Florida two years ago.
Yes and it is dangerous
Yes
They can rob you, there is a lot of poverty as almost like a Latin country already
None
Yes and you know the Latin countries are known for the difference between the rich and the poor
It is true I see
The United States is becoming like that
None
Yes, but there are interesting things and one time I went to Texas and I liked the views
None
I have always liked the Colombian plains
Super hot
Super hot, but very pretty
I see.
The plains of Texas are similar, a little more developed and the broiled meat I like it.
I see there is
A lot of broiled meas as bouth in places like that.
See
It is interesting, I would like to know Texas more.
None
Through its views, through the plains above all, I love the plains the flats the cowboys I like them
The horses
And the barbecues.
I see,
As they say in Colombia, I love the barbecues.
Yes
And you find that a lot in Texas
That's great
Yes, I think it is one of the most interesting parts of the United States and I would like to visit Seattle because of its cafes. They say they have good coffee there.
Really? I didn't know that.
Yes
My parents are going to El Salvador in November for two months.
There are volcanoes over there
Oh, yes.
The scenery must be beautiful over there
Yes, there is. But then again, there's poor people, and
There's security
There are hardly any jobs
Yes that's the problem with all the Latin countries that have never been able to get ahead
Yes it's true
I hope one day they can do it
Yes, someday
I have heard the scenery there is very pretty because there are a lot of volcanoes.
And yes there are
And mountains, and you know salvardor beaches? how are they?
Yes, they are pretty good. There is one that is called Libertad. And there is another where there are a lot of swimming pools, and sea waves are very big.
Big waves?
Hi there, hi wave
There is a Pacific and and an Atlantic.
I thought it was just in the Pacific.
How many seas are? only pacific
Like here
Yes
Florida is the Atlantic
Yes
None
Because Colombia has the Atlantic and also the pacific, Colombia has two seas
None
So it is a very nice country, Columbia, because its beauty trumps many countries.
Yes, I can imagine.
Country is the worst but in beauty has much
OK
It has many queen models
The queen models
But there are many bad things
It's true.
Yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
Yeah
Of that situation, there are bad things.
I can imagine
And not only that, there is insecurities and
None
And when you do tourism, you do not want to go to place where something bad could happen
Yes, it is true
You want to travel to a place where that are not many insecurities.
None
Even though I tell you, one thing that will scare you
What is that?
I was never mugged in Colombia
None
In Spain I was once robbed
Really?
Yes madam
How weird
I got robbed, too, at a subway train.
None
They took my wallet
Oh no
They stole a hundred dollars
That was in Spain.
Not sure ? In Spain?
In Spain, not Colombia
And in Colombia where it's so famous for those things of
I see.
Nothing was stolen to me because that was one of the reasons that I always too good precautions
None
And in Spain when you are taking precautions
That's true.
Yes and you know something? There was a terrorist attack in there too
In Spain?
Yes, some trains were blown-up, they set up bombs, it was due to Arab terrorism
In Spain, really?
Lots of people dies in Spain; this happened in the train station that I used .
I see.
To take a few years ago, I used to be on those places where the attacks took place
And that happened recently?
About a year ago
None
Yes, if something bad is going to happen to you
None
It will happen no matter where you are.
That's true. I see.
Good night I am Joe
Hello, where are you from?
I am from Colorado
From Colorado, and originally?
From Puerto Rico.
I am in Idaho and am from Chile
How long have you been in Chile?
In the United States ten years, in Idaho three.
You've been here ten years?  Do you like it? Do you miss your homeland a lot?
Well, it's like Colorado.  Actually not, since Colorado has a lot of snow
This is the season of change!
Of course
From cold to hot, or from hot to cold?
Of course, and Puerto Rico is not like that, right.
Today Puerto Rico is. the same weather every year., rainy moment and its very sunny moments throughout
July can be very sunny, and May very rainy.
But no snow
No.
How long have you been there?
Oh, I have been here more than twenty years
A lot. And since we talk about travelling, have you travelled to Puerto Rico?
In ninety-three since was the last time that I traveled to Puerto Rico.
And I have gone, to other places, and parts of the United States also including Florida which is a
Yes
One of my favorite places.
You have not always lived in Colorado, you have traveled
And vacations to other states, here there is a lot to see, I don't know if you have had the opportunity to see other places here in the United States.
But there are many very beautiful places
I went to Washington
Washington state that is very beautiful there
To Washington, of course. But no, not to the East. Of course, some day I hope to be able to.
Aand how did you come to stay in Idaho?
To study
None
We came here after I graduated from, from high school, to, to study at University here.
Yes
Then call you, because I was expecting, than calling me
How great.
But we have only gone back to Chile once, five years ago. And
And
We hope to go back now,  this coming year perhaps.
And it's very hard to travel from here to there because of things like passports and things like that.
Not so much, but it's more expensive than Idaho. I think that if were in Florida or California, which is the North right?
We are down below
In the middle. Okay, then down below, but around the center.
Yes it is centrall located for flights.  They travel a lot from here to South America.
Then it is easier to fly
I spend some vacations in Cancun
Right
And went there for three days with around three hundred fifty dollars
Oh no! Really?
It includes the hotel and the flight.
Did you see? That's why we don't go anywhere. It costs more than three hundred dollars per ticket. It is very expensive.
Probably it would be easier for you to go to the State of Washington. Or a more centrally located place and fly somewhere else if you'd like to.
Yes. Have you traveled outside America or you have not had the chance?
I'd love to go to Europe.  One of my brothers lives in Whichita, Kansas and the other lives in Puerto Rico.  They travel a lot.
Yes
They have traveled to, Paris and Spain, and said it was very beautiful.
What country, would you live to travel to if you could?
One of my favorites is Australia.
Yes, in Australia
Australia is facinating and exciting, so is New Zealand. I would like to visit Italy, Spain, and france, but I think Australia is number one.
If I could pick, I think it would be Italy.
Italy is beautiful.
Yes but I'm not sure, maybe Italy; although Australia is huge. There is so much to do there.
I worked for a company with an Australian CEO. We developed a great friendship.
And he would always invite me to go there, but I have a daughter of five years, I am a divorced father.
None
Have divided custody.w
Of course.
So,
You will stay,
I would never abandon her.
Of course. At least five more years
Yes, when she forgets she has a father and starts to think in boyfriends. Yes.
Of course. When she doesn't want anything to do with you for a short time, right?
I am crazy for her and she is crazy for me
Of course, right now is difficult.
We have a great time.
We have small children also and that makes it complicated to travel.
Right. well I want to go to Puerto Rico next year so that she knows her Puerto Rican half, because her mom is Mexican
Of course
Grandma comes here every year and they do great with each other
You're going to take her there, but what age are you planning to go
She
None
Travelled more than me in the last three years because she goes to Mexico, with her mother, at least two times a year
She's constantly
She's well used to traveling. She's really calm. I tell you, the first time we travelled it wasn't on the plan, but when we took a travel to Wichita
None
We went on a greyhound and it was awful.
Of course
She shaved her legs. She put on pants, put on dresses.
I can imagine
I think she thought she had a very bad nightmare, and people there was really uncomfortable, and they said stuff
Of course
And it was awful travel, but
How old was she?
When she woke up, she panicked.
She didn't understand
I promised I would never take her there in a bus.
None
The next time we went on a little plane and we had a great time.  She was very happly.  And it was only
Compared to thirteen hours travel, it is one hour when we took the bus.
Yes, that is so.
Yes
No, it is great tha tpeople like travelling because whe is going to want to travel.  People who really do not like travelling really cannot believe it.
It was horrible.
Who don't like to travel?
I would love to see the whole plane if I could.
Of course.
I love to travel but economy and situations is very difficult for me
You one who has children have to be here responsible
Yes, exactly.
Put your feet on the ground for a while.
You have the opportunity go to other places, come to Colorado
I have heard it is really slow.
It is beautiful, you come here,
Many woods
It has many national forests,majestic mountains, attractions points in the city,little bit of everything. But you go to the mountains and to fabulous places, the beauty as is you were in a paradise.
And how long have you lived there in Colorado.
I've been living here twenty-six years.
Wow
I'll be twenty-six in December. I came after a short time in New York
None
I came here with my first ex-wife.
None
We were married for ten years and then went separate ways.
And she was American or, where was she from?
But, she was half Puerto Rican and half Swiss.
None
She was studying. he took the classes as independent studies,  while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling in Mexico.
Yes
Yes we got along well, and we ended it fine at the end we realized we had different goals.
Does that one change a lot?
Change a lot
Back at that time
The mother of my daughter, it was a super short marriage.
Sure.
It didn't even last two years.
She is from Mexico
She is from Oaxaca Mexico
Yeah
We have a good father relation with this girl. We work very well together, and even went to her kindergarden shool today.
None
The teacher gave a good report on my girl, because she has a good heart.
She goes with my cousin's husband he wears her long skit
How rare is very rich.
She's very respectful has much love of God and she has good principals and she is hungry to learn.
Now where does she live?
My ex husband, you say?
Yeah,with the girl.
She is my sister
You can see her often.
I see her three times a week every week.more on other activities like today
Look how father.
We share with her
Good.
Yes.  That is good.
If you are from Puerto Rico it does not cost you to come in and out of United States
No, absolutely.
I have never understood where the United State's stands with Puerto Rico, because it is not a state it is a separate country, but
Well it was invaded by Americans in eighteen thousand and ninety eight.
Yeah
They took away from the Spanish. From there they established American governors, and from there they dominated until they start to govern. have Puerto Rican governors
They have puerto Ricans with citizenship just like in nineteen-fifty-four.
It has not been that long.
But Puerto Rico, no. Not that long. For example, when my parents were born they were not citizens, but I have been a citizen my entire life.
Sure
From then forward they started free commerce which is a free association with United States but without being a state.
Over there they vote for the primaries from here, but they do not vote in the presidential election.
Then in some way it is Independent
None
Independent or union with United States would be very difficult because Puerto Rico would become a totally independent Country because,
Independent.
They would have to approve first there but they have never approved and never been approved
Good evening Mildred
Hello, how are you? What is your name?
Mildred.
Mildred, I'm Arturo.
Where are you from Arturo?
I'm from Mexico but right now I'm in Philadelphia
Okay, and we talked
Maybe that's it.
Forgive me.
I don't think I did.  Are you in Puerto Rico?
Yes
If you talk
Puerto Rican mhm?
I play that you speak of, I do not agree that, all I remember now is the music
Today is the music
Yes, it is very good music.
You like it, don't you?
A lot harder
None
You touch an instrument
What music do you listen to?
Well, I like all music, jazz, a bit of classical. I listen to contemporary, alternative and fusion music
It's like a merger of jazz
Rock and all that
A break
Reaggeton and all that
No, do you like Reggaeton?
None
Do you like Reggaeton?
I listen to reggaeton, rap, and everything else.
Yes, sure
Rock, I don't like it that much but I do listen to it. I can't listen to it for a long time, just a bit. I can spend a whole night listening to Rock music, no.
I'm not a Rocker.
I like rock.
I like Bachata, Merengue, Salsa, everything. Classical music.
Yes
Romantic music, nice, yes, I think that music let's you know a bit about other cultures, it helps get to know people from other countries.
Yes, but
And
Everyone is making the same music.
In the United States; in Mexico they are just copying it. It's become a global gender.
I've listened to it, I don't really like it but it is impressive that everybody is now listening to Hip-Hop.
I think it's Reggaeton, it's becoming popular
0
In Mexico, Mexican music uses lots of Hip-Hop and there are lots of rock bands that use Hip-Hop or stuff like that
I think that it is helping bringing people together, even if they are from many different nations, Mexican people like salsa, some others that are from
Yes
Different countries like salsa, too, and merengue, and bachata. And when you go to dances,
Yes
There
I do enjoy dancing merengue and salsa music
People from many different countries dancing.
Yes
I like Mexican music because it has a good rythm, I like Ranchera music, I love it, yes
Yes, Rancheras
I like them
Yes, they are good, I do like them too but, sometimes I don't know the tunes, it's interesting to get to know music from other countries like
Have you ever listened to Arab or Turkish music?
Yes, Aha!
That's interesting, it's good too.
The chinese music is very beautiful
Yes
Yes, especially if someone knew how to interpret, it would be more beautiful because they always present like a history when they do presentations, of them with the woman that are moving their hands
Yes, and those fans
Yes.
They use it to tell...
Since they tell something with music, the music has no lyrics, so they are painting an image.
This, a scenery, having lyrics always makes it related to feeling or story, or the Mexican music like the corridos
The storytellers are well known for telling stories of different people and different events.
We are brought to old times with the natives.
Yes
The slaves were the first that used music and dances in order to complain and say
Yes
The evil with which they were treated, they were expressing all of their
None
Their discontent
Yes
I believe that music will always continue for centuries
Clearly
Reggaeton will always unite the people wherever you go
Yes already
I don't know if you remember that Japanese band The Band of Light.
I see
That they began to play salsa
No.
Yes, and they were Japanese and spent a lot of time here and I didn't know that they would last but they played a lot in New York and they didn't have discos when they originally played.
The same salsa discos that they did in Japanese music
Japanese
If japanese came here they would be safe
No I have never heard of them
They can say it, although they don't understand
I see
I think that's pretty and relaxing music.
Yes. Me too.
One of it's uses is to relax.
It's very relaxing for distractions.
I have discos while going out in Puerto Rico with the music that came that was recorded in Rio.
None
It's one to relax to
Yes
When you want to be quiet at home you can light those scented candles and relax. That helps a lot
Sounds like pure ambient
You need music
A little more aggressive
Yes. It is that music is
Music calms you
Music can be very important also like for liberation
There is a singer whose music is called Afro bit, his name is Cela Kuti and this gentleman,he for the civil war of Nigeria
He was very important because he made revolutionary movements. People didn't see him as a musician but rather as a political leader.
None
Through the music he moved people. Then, when he released new albums.
None
The military was infuriated and some time he had the entire community who had the same political philosophy practicing like him.
All of them lived together in communities. When he released an album called Zombie, that criticized the army because they were like puppets of the government that were
People sometimes kill their own race.
None
He said everything in his song and the military heard it and
Yes.  They extradited him from the country.  They voted him.......
They jailed him and beat him and burned his whole house.
Yes because it was protest music they called it
The music
In Puerto rico they had topo, and who else sang that kind of protest music? juan Manuel sang protest songs, and sometimes made concerts.
Yes of course
They sang the truth about villages
Yes that it
Against the government
People that make a riot out of everything, and the government doesn't like that.
They try to to make people not go to those kinds of things.
Yes
But its interesting because they make history.
It gets involved in history, music will always reflect what other people are living in the moment, and what they think.
I think that same thing
Yeah, that's good
They need music.
Always
They tell love stories, disgraces, people problems.
Yes
Daily life has many uses.
Yes I think its necessary that we need air to live.
I think that when I put on music, I clean the house faster.
And if you don't play music, you don't play an instrument.
No, I've always liked the piano, and my daughters like piano classes, I never had the opportunity of my mom paying for piano classes for me.
Yeah
I like playing the guitar and the violin
The violin
The violin is an instrument that I don't know so much about, but it has precise music.
Not that much, i had a friend at school, that knew how to play the violin really good.
The violin is good,accordion music as well.
Yes, but like you said, Mexican music uses a lot of accordions.
In Puerto rico people we call it 'gicaro' of land, when they go out for Christmas and all that.
Yeah
You don't play an instrument
I play the guitar and base. And I've tried playing the piano, but it's too hard. I can't do it.
I just left it there.
My boyfriend plays bass, but not anymore, he's older now
None
But
Yeah
He played with bands and groups he played the base
It's always good to play music
None
That serves to let it off one's chest. When I want to get distracted, I take my bass, and I play a little.
I see, it relaxes you
It distracts me, if it relaxes me
I see, that is good.
Yes
It's good, we have a lot of that.
None
Because he does -DJ-
None
DJ so, there is music around the whole house
Ok
Is everyone on the internet recording all the time?
Yes
And we make records for people if they want
None
Sometimes we have done parties and he records a cd full of songs and we give it to the person as a gift
Yes
None
To father is my uncle does something very similar as well, he also it was like dj
None
He has not worked so much, he is with other jobs but also records
Good evening, I'm Joe.
Good evening, Cristina from Idaho.
How are you Cristina?
Where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but I live here in Denver, Colorado.
For how many years?
Oh, very long. I've been here like twenty-six years.
None
And you?
I've spent ten years in
Where are you from?
From Chile
Haven't I talked to you the other nights?
I think so, your voice sounds familiar.
You have your family, your husband, your children
You have a little girl correct?
Yes, a five-year-old girl.
Yes I remember. How is your daughter?
Good, growing, becoming very pretty, and sweet
If your'e going to ha you'll want to be careful with the boys
Right. So, at that young age, she asks me when she can have a boyfriend. I say, a lot of time will pass before that can happen.
At twenty five years
Yes, more or less. It could be.
Why come?
Tonightâ€™s topic is
Where do you live?  In a big city?
Denver is a pretty big city
None
I live in Aurora nearby Denver.
None
It's a city too, pretty big, but is doesn't have tall buildings like Denver.
And a little more quiet
I wouldn't say that is more quiet, i would say
None
Because it has a mixture of all,
None
Good people, bad ones, every ethnic group. You have high crimes around too, and you seem to live a little fear
None
I lived in a house before. I live in an apartment, and I found some nasty situations around here.
Yeah ?
Including gun shots and things like that.
What kind of place would you like to live in?
If I could go, I would go to a calmer place, a small village, rather than a city.
None
I am tired of the city, i drive here every day, and the traffic in denver is horrible.
Yeah
Too many cars, and the school where my girl goes it takes me a long time, and sometimes waiting for about an hour and half just driving, before going to work.
Wow
When you arrive to work you're all stressed out
A little more relaxed
With a big headache, yes
The difference is that it is calm here.
Yes
Really calm
Is it a village?
Idaho is mainly land.
Yes
I man the biggest city, Boyce
Yes, over there.
But its a relaxed city and it kind of small
Yes
And that is the biggest city.  The next biggest, I would say, if Idaho Falls, Idaho.  But I do not cpmsoder tjat os as bog/
Yes
Because it's not a city. there are no big buildings
Yes
And so there is, it's what is here, it's a big town. But
And how is the crime, and things like that?
Oh, nothing happens. Here, people leave the doors open, their cars unlocked.
How cool
And
That doesn't happen in Aurora.
Of course, its very peaceful. No dad, the daily news here talks about someone lost something.
If something did happen it would be the news of the
They're not about crimes, nor any of that.
Of course of the month.  No absolutely not.
What most delicious thing.
Too quiet.
Well I'm going over there then, to be your neighbors.
It's super peaceful
It's all the opposite of Denver
Yes
Aurora.
It is too quiet. There is not much to do. Here the people like things outdoors
Yes
Camping, and fishing, and going to the mountains to ski, and
We like going to the mountains, camping, etc.
Of course, well.
There are people everywhere.
Of course
Many places that who have come these people, they have brought many bad habits too.
Of course
Things happen that make you live in fear.
Of course
With my daughter I am always in fear, because there is a lot of talk on the news of what happens in crime in Aurora
Of course
What? Yes, shots. They stole this, they ran over a kid, and the driver of the car is on the run.
Of course
Things like that.
Like city
Sorry?
I used to live in Chile. I also lived in Santiago it's the capital.
Yes
It's different to live in a city. I mean, you can't leave your doors open. You can't trust no one
You can't leave you're car, the CDs.
Sure
They break the windows to steal them
Everything
The CDs
Yes, that doesn't happen everyone, but
I never leave anything flashy in the car.
It is a  quite, safe and good place to raise kids.
That's good. I dream of a place like that. The only problem is
That's why.
I have, a divorced father, I have a daughter
Sure
My ex-wife and i share custody
You have to be close to
Yes, I would never leave my girl behind. I want to stay near her until she grows up.
Sure
One day, she'll get married and forget about Me! I hope that won't happen, but it does most of the time.
It happens a lot
Yes
But, nothing, I would like to, live in a more quiet place. My brother lives in Kansas
None
And it is very quiet there, also.
Of course.  No.
They have festivals, people are more quiet no.
A little tired, yes. But God willing, in two or three weeks, when I have the baby, I am going to feel better.
Here, there many beautiful things. Not everything here is ugly or anything like that.
Of course
It's since there are people living and more people moving,  there are cities in Colorado that are more bigger that the ones growing in most of all America
Of course.
That also has its problems.
That is what I miss. Because here there is a lot to do. Besides the things you do outdoors, there is no opera here
The mall is very small. There are no places to visit, or ballet, concerts, and things like that. Those things are not around here.
Then that one is a city that is in Utah.
Yes
If you like t do things like that, go to concerts, opera, theater or a show.
No, there is not. You have to drive three to four hours to see something like that. Nothing happens here. The only thing is the universities, those have time shows.
You miss that from the city? No, that
Yes
You can find that type of fun stuff, but at the same time there is
No, here you have the opposite. Here, they have
With all the tranquility and other. I liked that a lot, when we lived in Utah
Yes
In the city you have all that you want
Yes
It's quiet.
And it's right, you have lots of relaxing parts. And there it has lots of family attractions,
Right
For adults, for singles, everything. In reality you have all that right here we I work, it's a high-tech company are of
None
Then, too, there is an amphitheater one block from my work, and sometimes we hear the concerts while working.
Right
THE BUILDING
I would like to live near things that have activities and stuff
Ere you don't miss he activities. in the city you have lots of crimes.
You have parts of right here, border areas too that are fairly quiet and
None
Even though there are lots of people, they care each other pretty well without fear of robbery
Of course
In this, as a limit to, it is a mixture of good and bad.
Of course.
Understand? The bad ones, well they are the ones who like to take advantage.
Of course
Do you live with fear or calm?
Of course.
But traffic is horrible, let me tell you.
Well, I don't really miss.
It is really horrible. Because sometimes taxi drivers and on winter days it is still worse. Because when there start to be all these accidents and you cannot move on the highway
Snow and ice and all that.
It is terrible.
That is not at all strange
I always dream like that with a quiet place. Some day I think that whatever, it is going to be possible.
Well, yes. Because where your daughter lives, she lives very close, too. No?
She lives close to here, I live in Aurora, Colorado and she lives about three miles from there.
None
In what was my home. And also to the home of my ex-wife, which was my house then, they came in also. One time, they came in through the
Because the house has three levels.
None
And in the basement, it isn't like a basement. What did it stay up, the windows?
OK
Then they get in through the back and the basement, I mean below the house, and they steal a lot of things from it.
They were not in the house.
No, she had gone with some coworker. I went to the house and inspected, and gave her my recommendations that she will have to lock this and that because
It doesn't let it exposed to the thiefs right
Sure
They have get in her car about three times
That's makes me angry
Three times they have broken her windows, took her cds, they had robbed her stereo
That's make me angry
That's a bad thing about living in the city, there are too many kinds of attractions!
You have to
Disadvantages
You have to be careful.
I missed that.
There are somebody who comes from other place and take advantages of the circumstances.
Exactly
They relax
Hey.  Do you have.......
And
Sorry. Continue.
For example when that happened, the news here were that this man came and killed his family, and he took away two kids
I remember that.
Yes, because, precisely, they are living here in the field and the children, you never know that somebody like that can come over here
Yes
And
Crime could happen anywhere
Sure
It's sad, that one
And you have to be careful always
And don't be so trusting with certain people, strangers especially
Sure
I teach my daughter not to trust strangers.
When you have kids, then you start to worry, that's terrible
You start to teach them, they don't have to knock here or there
Sure, when you have kids, at least you can take care yourself, but
Yes
You are not daughters anymore
Hello, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Maira habla.
Oh, Maira, how are you? It's Jose.
You're Memo?
Hello?
Who are you?
Jose.
Again?
Yes, again?
How are you?
Good and you?
Very good. How is everything going? How are classe?
I say why not rest a little bit?
Good.
How are you? How are your classes?
Me? Good. Everything's going well with this. I just got done with all the exams, and you can see that I'm in the week where you can't really do anything.
All
I haven't got used to it yet. It gets me down
No
In the morning I turn the window and get, get angry, ay, not again
Where are you from? or where do you live?
I'm in the high rises
Before coming here?
Where?
Before coming here to study?
I lived in Singapore for 2 years and before that it was Ciudad de Mexico
That's it
Yes
It's hotter here
I've getting used to tropics
It's very hot in Singapur, right?
Then, it's tropical. Nothing else, then.
Yes
What's going on?
And then here, it's cold and
Yes
None
And in the air it rains for a week, I don't understand how they can survive this time
No, there's cold, and yes, there's no sunlight. After the summer it feels nice, but a week like that, a little cold
Not a lot. I like that, but yes, it is only the beginning of a terrible winter.
Yes
This is what I don't like
What happens to the cold until December is
Christmas will be over when you return
None
When the cold hits me at Christmas it knocks me out!
None
Yes please
Yes, I know my brother studies in Cornell, which is farther north, about six hours from Philadelphia, but is
Further north
Yes
It is so cold that classes don't start until the end of January, until maybe the 28th of January.
Wow. Really?
He says that it is so cold that it is better to spend more days in May than to spend the days in January Right? The students Because...
Ah
You are 15 years old?
It cannot be
And my brother.
And I was thinking about going there. Good that I didn't go, I couldn't survive.I swear that I wouldn't survive.
Really, and my brother well he was lucky enough to get a what they call a town house
Yeah
But, it was a lot bigger, then you went in and they had a little living room and a kitchen, and then you went up and they had all the rooms but
They were some of the university's new dormitories
None
They had built it in the university's outskirts, so it was pretty far from the university.
The engineering classes were held at the other side of the university
Poor guy
There's a bus system there
Why don't you use public transportation? Because I don't want to pay the fifty dollars.
None
He spend the whole semester walking, and during the winter, it was like twenty degrees, and he walked, he walked forty minutes to get to class
My brother
Poor guy
No, It's
He brought it on himself
He's just cheap, right? He didn't want to pay the fifty dollars, so I said that's ridiculous.
No, because the bus only stops four times every hour, so he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes, something like that
None
My brother
What grade is your brother in?
No, now he is in the eighth grade
Okay.
Yes
That's fine.
What do you think about the crime wave here in Philadelphia?
About what? About the crime wave?
The crime wave, yes.
I have not heard much about it here in Philly or rather I have heard that were some persons who are rob on forty first or whatever.
None
But I think that I have always been lucky. Because I have been walking alone at night on 41st, and going to the store,
I go to the fruit shops on forty eighth and nothing has ever happened to me.
Do you walk to forty eighth street?
Yes, by myself as happy as ever with my life. Besides, I don't even think about it, not even paying attention. I don't walk around in fear or anything like that.
None
And nothing has ever happened to me, I have no reason to be scared of anything, to the contrary,once I get there they are all super friendly.
Then I'm not sure
Yes.
I think I'm lucky because is the same in Mexico. In other words, all my friends in Mexico have a story about been robbed or kidnapped or something that they have done to them.
Nothing has ever happened to me even when I'm along late at night in bad areas. All those things they say you shouldn't do
I understand
I've done all of them at the same time and nothing has happened to me.
The
Yes, trust me. I see what has been done. Yes, I remember what I have done and I say to myself, how did I dare to do that?
What was I thinking? I was a very irresponsible teenager, but nothing happened to me.
None
Have you met Philly?
Good
What's it like?
With me it is the same old story.  Nothing has happened to me either.  So I think I live in.......
I live in Walnut, between the thirty eight and the thirty nine
None
It's not that far away, and there are lots of police here. In general, I haven't met anyone who has gone through that, so I really think that
It does happen, right? I read it in the paper and
Yes.
I think in general it is weird because we have so many security cameras around here.
Yes, we do too.
Lights and they have some phones, cops have bikes, it's unbelievable that they have
They spend lots of money in that but in general, they are keeping us safe.
Yes, they have lots of them
I imagine that the people from the neighborhood are criminals so they have to be careful with security.
I think that they can to the people that do crimes, in general, its very safe.
In the, quad, because before that it was security  no it wasn't so strict, because one had to pass there, and one gave the card to someone else.
And then they would go get him. Ask, What's his name? to the system, to see if one was actually a student from there or not.
They didn't make an illegal copy of it, right?
OK
The thing is that people could have gone in and out like nothing, but they now have those systems, those new doors, that
You can't do anything so they won't worry about one person in the University.
Yes
None
Yes, in general, in Philadelphia there are a few zones where I wouldn't go.
Yes
I don't like it, like at night like in the center city there are a few places where I don't like walking too.
No
I don't really know the city well, I don't know the people here.
Yes
I mean, in Mexico, I would see someone, and then cross the street or not.
None
And here its like I don't know. It's like I'm scared about something or someone.
Yes
No
Philadelphia has lots of neighborhoods that are dangerous
Yes
They have secure neighborhoods, right?one has from the university that is secure
Yes one goes north, north philly, all that then south philly, and west philly, its not necessary
It gets dangerous. If one wants to go out at night, they won't go to North Philly
Yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
None
Well, for us
Yes me too.
Why yes, if one goes out, one goes to Philadelphia, but that's an old city, so they have cops and everything.
So
But, why don't you know anyone in Philadelphia that knows history about robberies.
Yes, in general there aren't really many students in the old city. The majority of the student stay in the university.
Okay.
I think, in general, but people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood.
Generally every week someone will read the
There was a robbery, or something, so one goes, and naturally thinks, what's happening. Right? but
None
Twenty thousand students will jump
That happened to one
Yes, also
Of course it exists, right? But it is not that tall.
Of course, they are in a lot and neither is that much more expensive that happens if you are walking alone or in
Yes
That is how it always happens
It seems to me, it is better to live in university high-rises because if one returns over there in the night
It is very calm
Well, it is nice to have to
Do not worry about anything
The squares in Baltimore are huge.
And there is not light.
Yes, huge.
No light.
There is no light
On the blocks
Yes, there is no light. In high-rises it is better, more calms one does not have to buy all of the furniture
None
If something happens, one calls the university and they take care of them
Yes
I've heard a lot of stories of problems between people that share an apartment.
Hi
Hi, who am I talking to?
Hi, I am Olaya, in Philadelphia
Olaya, I am Arthur
Are you spanish?
I am from Mexico
Very well, nice to meet you.  And from where are you calling?
From Philadelphia as well, in fact. Yes.
Good
Do you work or study in Philadelphia?
Right now I am studying
Okay
At Penn, the university
Me too
What do you do?
Chemical engineer, an undergraduate
None
And you?
I am in the linguistics program
Do you have something to do with this program?
Know people who wear it and I know the LDC and what they do.
Ah. Okay.
But, no.
How final are they making this program
What the LDC does is collect many types of linguistic data. It might be text, or something spoken, and then it can be used for many things. For example,
None
Programs that understand voice need traning
Okay.
A supreme being
Okay
And then, for example, it's possible for studies how people pronounce the letter this way, up to the dialog, how it develops, I don't know, what or for
Wow
For many things. And the LDC, they collect data for many languages, and then the people
None
Can do more things, more applications or more studies, more theories. Right?
More specialized.
Yes
Okay. And this where you live here in Philadelphia, in what neighborhood or?
I live in West Philly, but not very west, let's say I live at forty-third and Spruce.
That is not that west
No too much west
Yes, I live on campus.
And
I live on the 40th floor
None
In the skyscrapers
Yes.
And, how do you feel the air living so high at 43th?
Well, I like it a lot before I came here.
Yes
They told me, good, that Philadelphia was little dangeous and such, and
Yes
Caution with West Philly, including the guide that spread in the campus they say it's dangerous go out at night
None
Right, this is my second year.
None
I didn't see nothing and no bad things happened to me, I don't feel unsafe either
Don't know, because I watch few things. The news around here, they scare you a bit
Yes.  Also that.
And I don't know, I say nothing bad happened to me ever, and I would say I feel safe, I don't feel like being i danger. But I know people that do feel like that, they get scared about West Philly, and
There are a lot of people that get intimidated by black people here
Yes
Eh to me.
That is his problem.
Yes. It is how a lot of people associate West Philly with the neighborhood, like it was a ghetto?
None
The black neighborhood is unsafe
Yes, that too.
But
Tell me
I don't feel intimidated, because I have a good friend that I have lived close to for 45 years.
None
I walk over there frequently. At night too,
None
I meet a lot of people at night because I have to cross the park
Yes
Here are lots of people, there too, at night, then, at two in the morning they are rumbling there
Never threatened me. They never ask for a cigarette.
Mhm
Truly no, i dont see them provoking, there
It's true that things happen to people. I know a girl that was attacked.
Ok.
Those things happen in every city.
Yes
There are crimes in every city, and I believe that happens here.
Yes,
They give it much attention . It shows up on TV,  newspapers, and ends up creating a state of a bit collective.
Yes
Of psychosis, no and
Yes. I think it's exaggerated. So, people on their own make
Yes.
The idea it's very unsafe and not so much it's more the idealization, like of what they are thinking
None
They are making it more serious than it is.
Yes, and West Philadelphia does have some bad areas, but it also has some very nice areas to stroll around.
Yes.
And there are people that live in Center City, that never used to happen, to come to have a stroll around here.
That no.
I think that it's a nice neighborhood.
Yes, I don't dislike it at all
None
It's not particularly pretty, or nothing, but there's some good places to walk a bit
Live here as university student, if you want to be too far, you get disconnected from the university place and students
Yeah
Me too
Yes
The people that live in universities find it comforting
I kept going to Sesenta Street, then left.
Oh Yes
I wanted too see what was going on
And what did you find?
And I found a poor, ugly neighborhood, a few old houses not taken care of.
None
You could see it was poor, in a few places.
Yes
There wasn't anything disgusting, or something scary, you could have seen
Right?
Those kinds of neighborhoods usually make less income than others.
Yes, they make a lot less.
There are no white people in the street.
Yes.
The things that have surprised me the most avout Philadelphia are that the divisions are so large that there is still
Is that wan an impressing displacement is?
Yes.
It's impressing to see the further you go west there are more black people, and less whites.
Yes, and sometimes I take teh bus here in front of my house, and sometimes, when I get on the bus everybody is black and hte bus goes like changing colors, no? As it continues advancing.
Yes
When you go westbound
I have used the bus just one time. I recall of getting on.
Everybody was black when Iwas going to the eas- to the west
It is strange
The fact that the majority of black people here, is of lesser income.
Sure. It is a relationship with social class, No? more, tha something racial, it is clear, yes.
Yes, more than anything
Where you from Mexico?
From the Mexico City.
They say that it is dangerous
Over there is a lot more serious. It is not as bad here
None
It is very evident that there continues to be a lot of segregation of social classes.
Okay.
I am from, I have like an appearance that is much more, this, European, let's say. I am blond with white screen and light eyes
None
And if I could walk through some unsafe neighborhood of Mexico.....
Yes
Be sure that I am not going to go out with a purse
Wow
It will take one hour to catch me.
Aha
They might even kidnap me because it is more probable that they do that.
That I had also heard. Kidnappings
Yes, it is impressive. Now, it is interesting, because of the kidnappings, who they kidnap. I mean, it is no longer because you are from a family
Ok
Whoever take him in a care, call it as express kidnapping
None
This will cost thousands of dollars, if you have it.
None
The truth is, they can do very brutal things when they get desperate?
None
It it terrible. I mean, in the end, also there has been too much social conscience regarding the citizens. Now they are starting to oppose that, do you understand me?
People testify the attacks, people now do oppose
None
There has been much more involvement because before there was nobody.
People didn't do it before as they were afraid of report.
The security system didn't work. So, someone declares a crime and
None
It was a lot of paperwork that I don't know-that didn't work
Yeah.
You have been, well, let's say, a little bit more, well reaffirming the action, of, the policemen, and things like that
Mm
So people feel that there's more response to catch thieves and kidnappers.
None
Before those reports
None
There was a march in Mexico a couple years ago
None
About one and half years ago. That was called the Silent March for the Security of Mexico, where everybody walked to
To the city Zocalo
None
And there were millions of people, it was crowded
Wow
You can see them.  Everyone is dressed in white and they are all in the streets.
Wow, impressive
Then you can realize it is something socially needed. People are already
None
Much more attention to the security
No
Anything else
I don't know how is in Mexico. But, looks to me, the Tv
Causes fear because the news is local
Yes
Each robbery, they explain it in different ways, and then they explain it again and again
Yes
Actually
Too much sensationalism
Yes
Yes
And,
In Mexico no that much, because it is very excessive that
OK
Practically impossible to include every robbery.
I wonder.
Every rape, I don't know
None
Besides every mugging there is, there are some that are really big, like a kidnapping
Sure
Very drastic kidnappings, or the case of the Juarez deaths, that are
Alex, Besy.
It's Javier.
Oh. Hello.
Hello, how are you? I think this is good, I've never served as a jury but I'd like to do it someday, I don't know if you
I got a letter last year
Did you?
To serve on a jury but I refused
I've heard that it's quite hard because, it causes lots of trouble
None
Maybe you have problems,they have your record, your info about Courts, it's safer that way
I don't know, serving on a jury it's dangerous because it depends on which case you are serving
I mean, it's a
I see.
If you get a murder case or someone that sells drugs
Yes.
How do they call it?
Oh well, a drug dealer or something
I see. They can have friends, let's say he's guilty, so he can talk to his friends and say go after this person and kill his children
You are so right, they can say she looks like this.
Yes.
I mean, they can make your description and
None
They can, that could happen too but, they say thatit's optional if you, they send you a letter
None
Is it optional or mandatory?
No, I got a letter. I said no, but I sent a letter to doctor
None
Saturday and Sunday.
None
They said it was okay for me to no serve on a jury
Sure, it's
That was last year, so
Friend of mine got a letter like that but he's working, from six in the morning to four in the afternoon so no, he said he
The manager of his company said he was someone who was not able to skip work. Correct?
I guess he asked him for a letter.
Exactly.
He to be sent to the jury
Well, yes. But sometimes I think it would be find to attend, mostly is cases such as.
Rapes of boys and girls
None
Yes, you can serve as a jury, and how's that? If you can tell if the person is guilty and.
You can help justice be served quickly, so I think it will be good to serve on a jury.
So yes, I wouldn't want to be on one.
None
Because I cry a lot, and
Today I cried.
No, I don't want to see a video of something happening like a rape of a child.
You wouldn't be able to stand it if it's really horrible stuff
No that's so terrible
Where were you sent, in which state?
No, I live in Canada
You are living in Canada
Yes, and you?
I'm in New York
Oh, aha.
I was trying to tell you about a friend I had when I lived in Arizona.
I see.
Do they have the same system in Canada?
Yes I think so
You see, that's good.
Yes
I don't know how to tell you if the day is mine but we have to be careful?
We have to be careful because they don't tell you what type of case until you have arrived
Or so you
Where does it have to be?
I imagine that it should be a meeting or a section to say, explain the case
It is when everything is. You said yes, that you will do it.
You are already involved.
There, jury duty
There
Then I don't want to do it.
No too late
They said yes.
When it was your name, correct?
Besy, there
Petty , Sessy or Jessy?
No. Busy, with a B.
Oh, Besy.
And yours, Javier?
Javier, yes, yes, yes,
The mine is easy.
Are you living in Canada, how long?
An e-mail address
15 years.
Yes
How can you resist the cold?
I live in a town before, the winter was really cold and had snow
I see
Fell enough snow
Yes.
My husband and I decide moving to the beach
I see.
In another province
None
Here the winter is like rain.
None
It does not get cold.
In what state, that provinces or states?
I live around Vancouver, a province of British Columbia.  I don not know if you are coming tot he city........
Vancouver is not around Washington State?
All
I had plans to go to Vancouver because there were some friends from Bolivia
Oh, aha.
I lost the trail with them and I couldn't go, because they say to me life there is very calm, I am not sure if this is true.
A person with whom I spoke before told me you will live in a paradise. I say: why?
There are several islands all around and the Mar is very near and one can go to the United States.
None
Do you have a passport
Yes
You can go alone, crossing the border.
None
From here the border is about 10 minutes.
Yes
Washington, already.
Were are you origininally from?
El Salvador
Oh, yes. I see. I am from Ecuador.
None
You have a bit an accent as El Salvador. and even some day I'll see if i can go there, because i tell you here.
Already
Here, much like the justice theme, nothing is good
Ya and hay
And his, how?
I'm sorry.
Yes. Tell me.
No, how do you say that? Let's say you kill someone and they give you the death penalty.
None
Is there in some state from there, that?
What here in the United States?
The death penalty
Of course, yes they give you the chamber penalty of gas
I was seeing in the news,that this woman killed her three children.
None
She lives very close. not even two miles of distance from here. Like at one miles
Yes
My mother says they should kill her. I say it's better they put her in jail because she'll suffer more.
The other people in jail know what she did and for that
Ya
I say that they're going to
Imagine that a serial killer that killed someone
And then? The gas chamber? They have to be punished, yes or no? A few years
And of course something that will not cause suffering because if you kill one and
Yeah
They suffered ten minutes, but if they put him in jail the other prisoners
None
Poor thing
Yes, well, no...
People suffer.
You can understand that?
There you go, he's going to pay for what he did and
What he did. I don't know. why do the people that do that not
Yes
But then as I say not
What do you think. People are crazy
The people are crazy.
None
And as I say here, it's getting hard each time you listen to the comments that Canada were more calm.
Now, there something more calm
Yes
I imagine that health care of the United States is not as good or like
What do you call a card that they give you for health care? I don't know what it's called.
I don't know Medicare or something like that here.
I Medicare okay, that's it
Yeah.
It's not great
Yeah, exactly
Or is it?
And over there?
I would say that it's good
It's more fair
Yeah, here it's more fair
Today, that's great
Then over there
Hey and what is the job market like here?
Well they are looking for a lot of people to work construction
What kind of construction?
I think it's for constructing buildings.
Yeah.
Yeah, and they asked in other states.
None
Already, but if you have experience doing so build buildings or houses or something.
Yes
I guess we can ask for a visa, or something. I do not know.
Not because
None
I was hearing that this country, that Canada, needs a lot of people.
At least in the province where I study. I heard on the news yesterday that they needed people to
For this to work on construction
There's an internet program where you accumulate points.
Can go to work and the government helps all
Where?
Yes
Denver? I did not know that.
Yes is
None
Is that you can
None
I'm half interested in doing that, right?
Yeah
Would be good
Okay
And have you ever had any problems with having to go to court for that?
Me?
Yes.
Hello?
Hello? Sorry.
No it's fine, what is your name, where are you from?
John from New york
OK, my name is Jennifer, from New York
And you?
OK, So we are going to start this thing, finish quickly.
Yes, what was the topic? Did you hear it?
We are discussing interracial marriage.
I didn't hear it well
That was today's subject. So what do you think about interracial marriage?
You are in love with someone.
None
Yes. Marry whomever you want.
OK, well I
No.  I do not think I car.  No one else should care either.
They ask what, what we thought about if it is easier for certain races to get married
Not I
Blacks and hispanics, things like that, they wanted to know
I don't think that it is easier, but it is better. Because a Latin person with a Latina, it depends where you live, if you get married. If I am a Latino and I marry a black girl or something,
None
In lots of places, probably lots of people will criticize
Yes, they always criticize. They do it if you get married.
Yes.
Yes, yes you are, if you marry a Spanish girl
Yes, but what race are you?
My rather is Dominican.
Mother?
Both of them.
Both Dominican fathers. Good, I'm Puerto Rican
My husband is Puerto Rican too
Yes
Then that was a problem, too
With his
With his family, obviously, they don't like Dominican people too much
Yes
Yes, when you look around the race doesn't count too much because my husband says that too. If we go into details
It could be a family situation.
Yes
In my family there are a lot of professionals, we're a lot more educated
Yes
Unlucky. In some economical things we are more stable. However.
Yes
The only reason they don't like me, was that the last girlfriend was Puerto Rican
And I'm from Dominican Partents, born here, raised here
Yes, I have some Dominican family
Yes
I have many cousins married to Dominicans.
None
They have dumped
Yes
Divorced and else
Yes
They are my family, I have a lot of Dominican friends
I can't understand the ignorance.
I have a family also. My cousins have married to brown guys.
My sister in law is Afro American
Where from New York are you
How?
From New York?
Manhattan
I'm in the Bronx.
That is theme for me
That's what I think too
I get it and for me it's no so big. Always when both are happy
Yeah
I care less they are green or yellow
I went out with girls of different tyoes.
None
They are..i don't know, i don't care. My first girlfriend was Dominican
Okay. The funny this is we're not all equal
Yes
Because a have some family members of my own, that i don't get along very well
I have some friends ad they are Dominican
And I don't like them.
But they say the are Dominican, they don't tell that around that they are Dominican, because they treat them bad.
Yeah
He rudely said, I have and they don't, because their family says that too
None
They call them rude
She's two as well, right?
They are quite nasty
Yes, but
They themselves feel ashamed to see, and I said that that does not need to make them feel ashamed because it is there in all races
But exactly.  i love telling people.  I tell them in my professional life.  I talk with all kinds of people and what I say is
Where are you from? I am Dominican.
Yeah, I know one guy, ok
What? Where from? How can that be, I believe it was you, what does that have to do with it?
I am a policeman
None
He has tattoos, with the Puerto Rico flag
None
I always thought he was Puerto Rican, until two or three weeks ago. When we made a barbeque to tell summer good-bye.
None
He was talking there, and the wife was talking there, and something came up about him making a vow to the flag. I didn't know that, and they said he made the vows to the flag, that he was not Dominican and all that. And he made
None
He made himself a citizen here
Hm mm.
He always said that he was Puerto Rican and changed his documents to tell that he is Puerto Rican
But this is
Well, he was not born here. But he changed everything with the parents, and all that.
He is your friend, but that is ignorance, because
Yeah, I said, but why did you do it, then he said, because those people have not, they don't talk to me. He doesn't
You know
He doesn't want to know anything Dominica, that is not like that because right now, there are Puerto Ricans who don't want to know anything from Puerto Ricans
Yes
For their life they say, I am Puerto Rican.
It is that. No.
THEY NEVER CHANGE WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULDS CHANGE IT
Exactly
I am Puerto Rican American
I'm sorry that is ignorance.
I being Dominican, hey I am Dominican, because I cannot change it.
That
He has been paying; he is from Puerto Rico and New York.
And still you, being that they have nothing to do with that.
Hm mm
That doesn't change at all.
Yeah I am working now
None
The Bronx is filled with Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.
None
A lot of people think that Dominicans are gross or that they don't know anything.
There's all classes, in all the races.
There are more Dominicans than whites you could say.
And now because of this you have Dominicans, that love to multiply.
Yes
Have kids.
The Puerto Ricans didn't say anything. The more Hispanics and Latinos that come in, the better.
Yeah
The little whites have a lot of Dominican
Yeah
This one Puerto Ricans want to grab
But this
So.
I feel like speaking English
I know, I'm getting up there too
This is because the brother is a policeman here in Manhattan
Yeah.
In my thirties and already I have a house. He and I work with investigations, but I work mostly with policemen.
Yea
So that.
Yes
Just a moment. Where are you from? Then they talked to me for a while after I helped them, Dominican people say things in front of me
They said oh yes, then blah blah blah, they tell me, oh where are you from? Dominican
Yes, i speak like Dominican like that
None
But in front of them, and the Puerto Rican
Yes no
There are some people who keep talking until the other person gets the point!
Yes. No.
We are talking in a group, it looks like he is Dominican, but I am talking with the group.
Okay.
Two or three dominicans with two or three Puerto Ricans.
OK
We chat with whities
Yes, because
But
The difference is that you can criticize a person and describe it, like that Dominican in the corner.
Because when I watch people on the street I know they are Dominicans because they have a flag
Okay.
I am Dominican, I came
Yes exactly
Yes
Unfortunately, the worse Dominicans, the ones that do all the things, are always painted, they have tattoos
Yes like the
They have a shirt
Yes, like women.
Yes
That from a distance for a reason.
Yeah, that also, but we are not all like that. That is a funny thing because when I was in college that was, where are you from?
New York, what ethnicity are you, I'm Dominican
All
I don't think so
Turn around
No, that one in unfortunately that's a trait we all have. But, still, it's the point of
Excuse me. The point is that we are, or because we have that attribute.
Yeah,
I don't mean that we are all the same.
Yea
I have cousins that make me ashamed
No, I didn't mean it that way, I meant it with the back part
Let's go to the heart of it
Yeah
They are like that, and have persons too
Yeah
We are professionals and we do what we do, and pitifully ok, my grandmother had a nice bottom, and we all inherited
Right, it's like.
But
So what, if they are sluts like you said
No
Puertorican,
We all have one
Dominicans, hell yeah!!
Yeah, but I don't. That's such a simple thing. You know you are Puerto Rican, I am Dominican,
My family with their own cousins
Oknow
I know that for a fact
But what kill me is that we're so close in proximity
Yeah
Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are what, like niety miles apart? We're closer than Florida and Cuba.
Yea
And we hate each other just because of where we were born- what is that?
Yeah. It's because some say, oh, Dominicans think they're better than us, and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us. Like that.
Exactly, but you know
That's all starts, even in the computer checking out the chatrooms
Thinking..
We're fighting like crazy
I never deny my race, but I usually don't tell people until I'm asked
The reason why I part asked you why you're from New York
(utterance only)
What part of New York? Because you sound white.
Get out of here
Yeah, you sound like white.
Thank you so much, I speak Spanish like a white person, too?
But nothing of course. Not now, let the Spanish come out.
Let me find out, okay? That's another thing that bothers me. What does it mean to some white
Like
You know what I'm saying
I told you I'm from the Bronx, I thought that they were going to hang up, because I had three callers, I told them I'm from the Bronx, and they hung up.
I wonder.
They hang up on me
No abs-please, I'll tell everybody I don't care.
In Florida's Disney World
Hm mm
It was a line, and we were standing. A few said, Excuse me, because the line was moving but some other people weren't moving.
I see
And I had, I said Bronx New York, and they  honey, come on, they're from the Bronx, and they moved, and they got off the line like
Out embarassed
No, it's not your fault
I was like, oh well.
Not your fault, people act ignorant around me all the time, and say stupid things like that
Yeah
Hi?
Yes. Hello?
Hi, good night
How are you
Who am I talking to?
David
Oh, David.  It's Joe, or Joseph
How are you?
Where do you live?
Here in Connecticut, I already spoke with you last week.
How are you?
It was cut off the call
I don't know why
I don't know why it was cut off
I don't know what they are going to do with that
Howdy, How are you?
So much calls that, had been cut off. And, it seems that also
Yes
There is a lot of people that, there is so many calls that they haven't processed.Therefore, it seems to me that they don't know how many valid calls
Have every person. Therefore, i don't know what they are going to do. Because, already, are a to much people that, by example, my mother already have reach the twenty five calls
Yea?
There were several calls that did not cut out, so she doesn't know what to do.
But they still can call you, or no?
They still call her. They called her two weeks ago and yesterday.
They pay her just for twenty-five, right?
I think so. It's just that, in the end, it doesn't seem very well organized to me. And it surprises me, because
They've done that lots of time because the LDC did it a year and a half ago.
Yes, to do it in English right.
But before, yes. It was in English, but they also had it in Arabic, and in Spanish, and whatever. But that's already an old story. They've already done it lots of times, or at least once.
None
I  don't know now because it is wunndly all new to me again; but, at that time for several months...
Yes.
No,
It's pretty clear because the other time they had the topic it was about religion.
And they were like fifteen or twenty days it was all the same topic.
I know. No and not just the recorder that I think was a type of computer or something else they had there.
Yeah.
And they tell her , that's my theory, that what they were saying was they write the text in English, for what they wanted for her to say
You could hear it, right?
None
Then, they went to the auto-this, translator, then, they put the text there.
None
There are computer programs that do that from English to Spanish
Put a lot of text then the computer reads it.
Right,
No, the translator was something like this type, I imagine.
None
What it talked about
None
Imagine that it was a computer.
Of course.
It did not only have a bad accent, but everything it said when the calls ended.  It said........
Your time is above.
No, I haven't seen it often, because when
No, I didn't either. I never checked until various times that I heard it, I didn't understand anything.
Yes.
One time the topic was Dating
Then,
None
The translation in Spanish was to date. That way, how do you like to date it? Things like that are
Yeah
Incredible. Obviously they have people who speak Spanish? I don't know.
But it depends
I has not been very well organized
If you send them an email they answer you the next day
Shudong, yes. But, the good thing is that they pay well. One is a little annoying having to answer
It is not a big deal.  And they pay well.
Yeah, but with me, the other time I did it and it was over.
None
They didn't call me again and didn't have a phone number to call them  but they sent me a check
None
You know, about sixty days ago, maybe two months ago, and they sent me a check.
NA
Until I forgot it, I never knew.
A surprise,
And do you live in Philadelphia?
Yes in Philadelphia, my mom lives in the outskirts. I live here, in West Philly.
Okay.
At the University. Then,
You live in the outskirts too, don't you?
That's here, sir.
You guys go to Penn State?
All the world is confused by University of Pennsylvania because Penn State
Is located in the center of the state
Yes
It is a public University.
Right
Yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
Ah in two different
Yes exactly, that is private, and is located in the city it is completely different. The other its much bigger and is public it is the countryside
Yes, those that are and another thing like that. No?
None
Where the wilds are. No?
I don't know. I have never gone there, I don't know exactly where it is.
Over there.
What is that in the center? Well, maybe in the eighty one, possibly, but although the eighty one I think will be more.
Possibly because I know the 81 well.  It's better I say nothing.
For mine it is the same
All that I know of the eighty one is that we used to live in Tennessee
Northeast
Alright
So we were living in Virginia, but then we moved to Tennessee. Then we found out that the eighty-one passed through there, but that's all I know.
Oh, Okay
It seems like its long highway
I wish i could work, I wish i could go to school.
Okay
But im,
It's a lot easier to imagine
Yeah, some people don't think about it, but when you're at school, that's where you find friendship. You dont have to go out to talk to your friends.
Not, The whole world relies in the center.
Yes
Then one is done, and has to go home, and has to pay the, the costs of the house, its really hard, its better to stay at school.
The good thing about being in university is when someone is done, one cost's rise.
A lot, so, fixed payments, fixed responsibilities. I don't know.
You need to try.
A lot
No.
No, the ramen soup costs twenty cents.
Yes.
If one could live off of ramon soups, it would only cost twenty five cents to eat dinner, but then again, it isn't that way.
Yeah.
You don't spend much less, but it's a calmer life but i think too that when the people remember when they were students, forget everything else. So in the workplace really?
Sure
It's a life that has more freedom, flexibility in time.  For example, if I want to spend tonight
Every night I'm awake studying. And if I have class the next day, I don't really care. Because some days, I don't have class, or I really don't want to go to the class.
Yes
But at work you can't say I didn't want to go to work today
Yes, it doesn't happens
Only that yes, no its very flexible
No, your skills
None
In life, when you go out to school everybody calm down, you know, they have family
They have children, and the life is more harder
Because the work, responsibilities you have
I can tell you how to live the American dream.
The American dream, they want to buy a house, etc.
Yes.  I think the trouble is you're not happy with what you have.
So, one has to buy a car, and you want one and then another. So then one would have to start working, right? In order to maintain yourself, while a student just lives there.
But at the same time,
Right
Everything that one consumes, goes to buy for a better car and one may do one thing and the other. And then when one sees, the money is gone right? And one stays there, it looks to me only with the responsibilities. Right?
Yeah
Right now I am happy as a student, but for now. Right? But eventually, of course, one has to save to buy a house
I don't know. That is scary to me, having so many overheads. Because that one works, and works, and works.
Yeah
One doesn't think of all the benefits of having money
It seems like a lot when one has to have the car to go to work and the other has to cut the grass.
Right, yeah
Let's say a sample.
You are more responsibilies in life.
Definitely
But in life of being poor, it is more difficult.
Yes, right
The life of being poor has nothing to do. If you want to work, you work; if you don't want to work you maintain it.
That is right
You know
The wife maintains him.
More or less
Yes
You have to get one, one good woman, that could help you, who has, a house, or an apartment, who helps you, for this and that. But,
Yes. Yes.
No, but life is like this, no? You know
Yes
Live and learn
I think so, that there  it is, because of that, that one has to have, like that, I think, be careful with
How do you spend money? It is very easy. For example, when you buy a house, then buy another house, and another. People don't understand anything. You feel that don't and aren't going to enjoy money.  Right?
You have to be serious to see
Right
What is more important. Right? What is it that you like to do?
Right No
And if not that. Then, it is better not to spend money on that. Right?
Tell me the large companies that are giving you stuff.
That is what it seems to me
Don't you see that big companies give you cars, no money down? They give you the stuff
